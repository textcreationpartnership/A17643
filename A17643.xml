            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of whoſe prayſe though Chriſoſtome and diuers others haue ſaid very much: yet if it bee compared with his deſert, it is eyther nothing or els but a litle.<note place="margin">Act. 9.15.</note> For with what praiſes ſhall we ſufficiently ſet him forth, whome the Lord himſelf immediatly after his conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended: Calling him a choſen veſſell to beare his name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Iſrael?<note place="margin">2.

            <p>And with what ornamentes ſhall wee decke him, whome the Lorde did ſo richely adorne? by kinred of the race of Abraham, by perſon naturally vehement, indued with ſinguler dexteritie, and of a noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by callinge an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſte, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly

called of the Lord vnto the miniſtery of the Goſpel. As he teſtifieth to the Galath. Saying,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.1.</note> Paule an Apoſtle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; God the father) &amp;c. immediatly taught from aboue. As it is written,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.11.</note> Now I certifie you, brethren, that the Goſpell which was preached of me was not after men. For ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiued I it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt. By the viſible gift of the holy Ghoſt inueſted into his miniſterie &amp; Apoſtleſhip. And finally by great ſignes &amp; wonders confirmed in the ſame.<note place="margin">Act. 9.3.

For ſeeing hee ſpeaketh vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtead of chriſt, bringeth a celeſtial doctrin, &amp; ſuch as is mixed with no error, we ought to heare &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue him as the voice of God from heauen. Knowing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that hee is of the number of thoſe of whome it is ſaide, he that heareth you heareth me, and he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you, deſpiſeth me, &amp;c. And therefore they commit moſt horrible blaſphemie againſt God, whoſe impudent mouthes are open againſt the apoſtolicall authoritie of ſo excellent an inſtrument of the Lord. But no doubt ſuche miſcreates &amp; rebellious wretches, doe feele the efficacie &amp; light of his apoſtolicall doctrine, whereby their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſtudies are manifeſted &amp; reproued, according to the ſaying of Chriſt, becauſe their deedes are euill, they hate the light, &amp; ſeeing they hate it, but yet can not extinguiſh it, they do what they can to diſcredite it. Yea and that which of all others is moſt abominable, they goe about by peruerting holy Scriptures to mayntayne and defend their diueliſh doctrine.</p>
            <p>Whence it commeth, that by abuſing the teſtimonie of
<pb facs="tcp:7612:3"/>
of Peter, they labour to perſwade the vnlearned, that the Epiſtles of Paule are harde to bee vnderſtoode and obſcure: Yea ſuch as miniſter cauſes of errores vnto the vnſkilfull, and therefore are not to bee read of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon forte, but rather to bee reſtrayned, and forbidden. The woordes of Peter are theſe: And ſuppoſe that the long ſuffering of our Lorde is ſaluation,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.15.</note> euen as our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brother Paule according vnto the wiſedome gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him wrote to you, as one that in all his Epiſtles ſpeaketh of theſe things: amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the which ſome things are hard to be vnderſtoode, which they that are vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vnſtable, peruert as they doe all other ſcriptures vnto their owne deſtruction. Which woordes doe ſo muche make for the commendation of the Epiſtles of Paul, that they muſt needes be very impudent, and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with extreeme malice, which wreſt them to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring of his doctrine. For firſt theſe woordes giue vnto Paul a celeſtiall and heauenly wiſedome. Secondly they teſtifie that he wrote his Epiſtles according to the ſame wiſedom, and that he wrote the ſame things, &amp; to <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> ſame faithful people to whom Peter himſelfe wrote. But it is added, amongſt the which ſome things are hard to be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtood. VVhat then? ſhall all the writings of Paule bee taken away from the people &amp; Church of God, becauſe of the difficultie &amp; hardnes of ſome certayne places? or rather were it not meete thoſe obſcure places ſhoulde bee faithfully, &amp; ſincerely expounded, that the ſimple might vnderſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By the ſame reaſon let the epiſtles of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo be inhibited &amp; taken away, for in them there are many things hard to be vnderſtood. As may appeare in his firſt epi. cha. 3. &amp; 4. And in his 2 epiſt. 2. But they are wreſted (quoth they) of the vnlearned and vnſtable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7612:4"/>Wherefore it were better they were taken from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, &amp; reſerued onely for the reading of the learned. By the ſame reaſon alſo all holy ſcripture may bee taken away. For Peter teſtifieth of them, that they are peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the vnlearned, &amp; thoſe are vnſtable. What more reaſon is there why the vſe of holy ſcripture ſhould bee forbidden all men, becauſe ſome by peruerting of them haue fallen to deſtruction, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the vſe of fire &amp; water ſhould be debarred al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe many haue periſhed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Did the apoſtle write his epiſtles to the Biſhops &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miniſters of Chriſt only, &amp; not rather to all faythful chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were at Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſa, Philippos, Macedonia, &amp;c? Did he write of ſuche things only as apperteined vnto the learned, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuch things as are neceſſarie to be knowen of all, and concerne the ſaluation of all? if he wrote to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only, why ſaith he? <hi>to all that be at Rome,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you learned Chriſtians be at Rome. If he wrote of ſuch things as concerne the learned only (&amp; yet wrot the goſpel or glad tidings of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt) why ſaith he?<note place="margin">Rom. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt: for it is the power of God vnto ſaluation to euery one that beleeueth, &amp;c.</hi> But if both the holy man directed his writings vnto all, &amp; alſo the thinges conteyned in them doe appertein vnto all, why rob they the vulgar &amp; common people or laitie (as they terme them) of that the holy ghoſt hath giuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? I meane the light of the Apoſtolicall doctrin &amp; reading of the holy ſcriptures. Contrary to the minde of Chriſo.

               </note> and ſpecially the laitie, that they ſhould get them Bibles, or at the leaſt the newe Teſtament. Contrary to the minde of the holy Apoſtle, who ſaith, to the Colloſſ. Let the worde of

Yea contrary to chriſt himſelf, who ſaith ſearch the ſcriptures, &amp;c. And yet they bluſh not, (how contrary ſoeuer they be to the pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of Chriſt &amp; his apoſtles) to boaſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catholikes of the world, &amp; ſucceſſors of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. But this is no newe thing, for vice hath alway delited in the cloake of vertue, ſuperſtition in the name of religion, and heretikes in the name of catholiks. How truly this is ſaid of the romiſh prelates at this day, we ſhal not need to ſeeke far for profe: onely it ſhall ſuffice to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them in their nowe and newe profeſſed doctrines with the ancient &amp; ſincere doctrin was at the firſt taught and receiued amongſt the olde and true Catholike ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</p>
            <p>The ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me &amp; ſubſtance of which doctrine is regiſtred by the holy ghoſt in this Epiſtle: whereat they doe chiefly ſtorme beſides all other the writs of that good man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth in a ſpeciall ſort, detect their Apoſtaſey, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince their hereſey, &amp; bewray their ſuperſtitious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. Howbeit the Church of God is not more bound vnto the Lord for any portion of ſcripture, then for this moſt excellent &amp; worthy epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Wherein is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined a cleare &amp; compendious Epitome of Chriſtian religion, as may eaſily appeare by the places therein diſcuſſed: namely, of naturall knowledge, ciuill duties, the lawe of Moſes, the Goſpel, iuſtification, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, grace, election, predeſtination, excaecation of the Iewes, and their reſtitution, of the ſacrifice of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of Magiſtrates, and ſubiectes, of bearing the weake, and auoyding offence, &amp;c. So that if a man
<pb facs="tcp:7612:5"/>
vnderſtand it, he hath a certayne way open vnto him, to the vnderſtanding of the whole ſcripture. VVherefore in my iudgement (and I am not of that mind onely) the godly can no where better beſtowe their labour to their edification in true godlineſſe, then in reading, ſtudiyng, yea and committing to memorie this notable Epiſtle.</p>

For preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which euils it is meete not onely that godly and faithfull interpretations bee deliuered vnto the people, but alſo that they be diligently exhorted, reuerently too imbrace them, as the good helpes of God giuen for their edification in pure and vndefiled religion: and ſeriouſly to reade, heare, and marke them, as the meanes whereby it pleaſeth the Lorde to illuminate their mindes with

And this is (right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) the onely cauſe hath moued mee to ſet foorth this tranſlation vpon the Epiſtle to the Romanes: whiche thing perhaps will ſeeme vnto many needleſſe and vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, conſidering that the Commentaries of maſter <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> were alreadie in Engliſh vpon the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

places as apperteine to your Lordſhips patronage) that they ſhould not be clogged with an Idoll, nor deſtitute of a guide, which I haue alway ſince my firſt comming into your Lordſhips acquaintance noted in you. For who is more meete to bee a Patrone vnto that, which tendeth vnto the profite of the common ſort, then hee who wiſheth nothing more, and ſtudieth nothing ſo much. Secondly, that knowledge of the latine tongue, wherewithall, amongeſt other qualities whiche make you truly honorable, God hath richly indued you. And whereby you are able to iudge what ſinceritie &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, I haue vſed in this kinde of labour. Thirdly, that bountifulnes and liberalitie which your Lordſhip hath lately ſhewed towards mee: which preſſeth mee euery way (ſeeing I am by no meanes able to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to ſhewe my ſelfe thankefull. And I knowe your Lordſhip doth not looke for any other recompence.</p>
            <p>Wherefore humbly crauing pardon for my bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and earneſtly beſeeching your honour to accepte in good part my poore Newyeeres gift, as a pledge of my good will towardes you.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Remember, that three yeeres agoe, when wee communed familierly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our ſelues, of the beſt kinde of expounding the Scripture, that reaſon which pleaſed you greatly, was alſo at the ſame time before all others approued of mee. For wee were both of this minde, that the principal point of an interpreter did conſiſt in a plaine briefnes. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing this is in a maner his whole charge, to ſhewe foorth the minde of the writer, whom he hath taken vpon him to expounde: loooke by how muche hee leadeth the readers away from the ſame, by ſo much hee is wide of his marke, or rather after a ſorte wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of his boundes. So wee wiſhed that amongſt them, which at this day ſeeke to further the ſtudie of diuinitie in this kinde of labour, there might ſome one bee found, that both ſtudied for faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or eaſineſſe, &amp; alſo gaue his diligence not to trouble thoſe are deſirous of learning, aboue meaſure with long commentaries. And although I know all men are not of this minde: and they which are not of this minde, haue alſo their reaſons which induce them to iudge ſo: yet notwithſtanding I cannot bee drawen from the loue of compendiouſnes. But ſeeing through that, varietie is graffed in the mindes of men, ſome thinges pleaſe ſome men better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome: let euery man heerin vſe his owne iudgement, ſo that no one man couet to bring all other men vnder his rules, So it ſhall come to paſſe, that neither we, who are more delighted with breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhall refuſe, or contemne their labours, who are more copious and large in expounding the holy ſcriptures: and they againe ſhall beare with vs, albeit they thinke wee are briefe and ſhort. I coulde not chooſe but make a tryall what good I might doe heerein to the
<pb facs="tcp:7612:7"/>
church of god. Not as though I had alreadie obteined that, which then ſeemed beſt vnto vs: either thought when I beganne that I could obteine it: but I indeuoured, ſo to order my ſtile or forme of writing, that I might ſeeme to apply my minde towardes that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. How much I haue profited herein, becauſe it is not my part to iudge, I leaue that to you, and ſuche as you are, to be eſteemed. Sure I am many will condemne my pollicie, in that I durſt make a tryall, chiefly in this Epiſtle of Paule. For ſeeing ſo many men of excellent learning, before this haue taken great paines in the interpreting heereof, it is to bee ſuppoſed, there remaineth no place for others to better that they haue alreadie done. And I muſt needes confeſſe, that notwithſtanding I was perſuaded my worke woulde bee of ſome value, yet this cogitation at the firſt did terrifie mee, for I feared to incurre the reproch of raſhneſſe, if after ſo many cunning workemen I ſhould lay hand to this worke. There are many Commentaries vpon this Epiſtle, both of the elder, and latter writers. And ſurely ſurely they coulde no where better haue beſtowed their labour: ſeeing if a man vnderſtand it, he hath a certaine way opened vnto him, to the vnderſtanding of the whole Scripture. I will ſpeake nothing of the olde writers: who for their pietie, knowlege, ſanctimonie, and antiquitie, are of ſuch authoritie that wee ought to contemne nothing, which hath proceeded from them. And name by name to recite all thoſe that liue at this day were to no purpoſe. Therfore I wil declare my mind touching thoſe who haue beſtowed ſpeciall paines heerein. <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> according to that ſinguler knowledge, induſtrie, and dexteritie, Whereby hee excelleth in all kinde of learning aboue thoſe whiche came foorth before him, hath giuen great light. But becauſe as it may ſeeme, his purpoſe was only to diſcuſſe the principall things: whiles hee ſtayeth in them, wittingly hee paſſeth by many thinges, which may greatly trouble a ſimple wit. After him commeth <hi>Bullinger,</hi> who alſo for his merites hath gotten great prayſe. For he had an eaſineſſe coupled with his learning, wherein hee greatly approued himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>Bucer</hi> hauing ſet foorth his trauailes, did (as a man would ſay) make vp the matter. For that man (as you know) beſides the hidden learning, &amp; abundant knowledge of many things, beſides the ſharpnes of wit, great reading, &amp; many other vertues, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:7612:8"/>
hee is almoſt inferiour to none at this day, to be compared but with fewe, and excelleth many: is chiefly to bee commended in this, that none in our time hath vſed more exact diligence in expounding the ſcripture then he. Therefore as I doe confeſſe, it were a token of too impudent emulation, to contend with ſuch men, ſo it was neuer in my minde to take from them the leaſt part of prayſe. Let them haue that fauour and authoritie, which by the confeſſion of al good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue deſerued. Yet notwithſtanding (as I hope) this wil be graunted vnto me, that there was neuer at any time amongſt men any thing ſo abſolute, in poliſhing, garniſhing, or ſetting forth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there was not place left for the diligence of thoſe came after. I dare ſay nothing of my ſelfe, but that I thought this my labor would not be vnprofitable: whereunto nothing els did euer moone mee, then the publique benefite of the Church. Moreouer, I well hoped that in a diuers kinde of writing, I ſhould not bee preſſed with anye ſpite of emulation, which thing I was chiefly to take heede of. Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip hath obteined his purpoſe, which was to open the principall points, wherein whiles he beſtowed himſelfe, he let many things ſlip, which are not to be neglected, not forbidding others to declare thoſe alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bucer</hi> is both larger then that haſtily hee may bee read of thoſe, are tyed to other buſineſſe: and alſo higher, then that eaſily he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vnderſtood of the ſimple, &amp; thoſe are not very circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect. For what argument ſoeuer hee taketh vppon him to intreate of (through that plentifull wit, wherein he paſſeth) he hath ſuch ſtore of matter, that hee knoweth not where to leaue of. Seeing therefore the one of them hath not purſued all, and the other is more large then that hee can bee read in ſhort time: mee thinke mine attempt hath no ſhew of emulation. Yet I doubted with my ſelf a good while, whether I were better make (as it were) certaine gliemings after them, and others, wherein I might gather thoſe thinges whiche I thought profitable for the meaner ſort: or els ſhold make an whole Comment, wherin of neceſſitie I muſt repeate many thinges, which eyther of all, or at the leaſt of ſome of them had beene ſaide before. But becauſe they many times varie amongeſt them ſelues, whiche thing, greatly troubleth the ſimple reader, who doubteth to whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them he might the rather leane vnto: I thought alſo it were
<pb facs="tcp:7612:8"/>
not amiſse, if by ſhewing the beſt interpretation, I did eaſe them of the paines of iudging, who of themſelues are not ſufficiently able to iudge aright: ſpecially ſeeing I determined to compriſe al things ſo briefly, that the Readers ſhoulde not ſpende muche time, to reade thoſe things with mee, which are contained in others. Finally, I had great regard, that no man ſhoulde iuſtly complaine, there were many ſuperfluous things heere. Concerning the profitablenes heereof I will ſay nothing: and yet perhaps the godly, after they haue read, will confeſſe that they haue gotten more heereby, then modeſtie will ſuffer mee in wordes to promiſe. And whereas I doe ſometimes diſagree from others, or rather am ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto others, therein I am to bee excuſed. For verily the worde of God ought to bee of ſuch reuerence with vs, that thorowe the diuerſitie of interpretations, it might not bee drawen aſunder of vs, no not one hay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e breadth. For ſo the Maieſtie thereof is (I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel how) diminiſhed, and ſo much the more if the ſame be not done with great choyſe, and ſobrietie. For if it bee a ſinne to pollute any thing that is dedicate vnto God: ſurely he is not to be ſuffered, which doth vnreuerentlie handle that thing, which of all other thinges are in the earth is moſt holy.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is abominable boldneſſe to vſe the ſcripture at our pleaſure, and to play with them, as with a tenis ball: which manye before this haue done. Yet a man might ſee at all times, howe that euen thoſe, who haue godly, religiouſly, and ſoberly handeled the myſteries of god, haue not alwayes agreed amongſt themſelues. For God at no time hath voutchſafed his ſeruants with ſo ſinguler a bleſſing, that euery of them, ſhoulde bee indued with a full, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and abſolute knowledge. And it is not to bee doubted but hee doth it partly to the end hee might humble vs, and partly to reteine vs in the ſtudie of brotherly communication. Wherfore ſeeing it is not to be looked for in this preſent life, albeit it were greatly to be wiſhed, that there were a perpetuall conſent amongſt vs in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the places of ſcripture: we muſt doe our indeuour, that neither ſtirred with deſire of innouation, nor compelled through luſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming others, or moued by any hatred, ne yet tickeled with anye ambition: but onelie conſtrained thereunto of neceſſitie, ſeeking nothing els then the publique profite of the Church, wee departe from the iudgementes of thoſe were before vs: and againe that

            <p>The whole Epiſtleis ſo methodicall, that the very entrance of it, is framed according to art. The workmanſhip whereof as it is to be ſeene in many things, which ſhalbe obſerued in their places, ſo ſpecially in that, that the principall argument is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen hence. For he hauing begun with the confirmation of his Apoſtleſhip, deſcendeth thence to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the goſpel: which becauſe it doth neceſſarily bring with it the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of faith, he paſſeth thereunto, the wordes of the text (as a man would ſay) euen leading him by the hande. And ſo hee entreth into the principall queſtion of the whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Sciliz.</hi> that wee are iuſtified by faith. Wherin he is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied vnto the end of the 5. Chapter. Let vs therefore put
<pb facs="tcp:7612:10"/>
downe the generall propoſition of theſe Chapters, to ſay, The mercie of God in Chriſt is the onely righteouſneſſe vnto men, whiles it beeing offered by the Goſpel, is apprehended by faith. But becauſe men are ſo ſecure in their ſinnes, and flatter, &amp; deceiue themſelues with a falſe imagination of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that they thinke they ſtande in no neede of the righteouſneſſe of faith, except nowe they be caſt downe from all truſt in themſelues: againe, they are ſo delghted with the ſweetneſſe of carnall luſtes, and ſounde a ſleepe in great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that they are not eaſily rayſed vp to ſeeke after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnleſſe they be ſmitten with the terrour of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore hee doth not onely conuince them of their iniquitie, but alſo being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted doth rouſe them from their drowſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, hee condemneth all mankinde ſince the worlde began of ingratitude: that in ſo excellent a workemanſhip, they did not acknowledge the workemaſter: yea when they were conſtrained to acknowledge him, they did not worthily honour his maieſtie, but prophaned &amp; violated the ſame with their vanitie. So all men are proued giltie of impietie, then the which there is no more deteſtable wickedneſſe. And to the ende it might more plainely appeare, that all men are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the Lorde, hee rehearſeth the fylthie and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable woorkes, whereunto euery where men are ſubiecte. Which is a manifeſt argument, that they haue degenerate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: for as much as they are tokens of Gods wrath, which appeare not but in the godleſſe. And becauſe certaine of the Iewes, and alſo of the Gentiles hauing couered theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wickedneſſe with the cloake of outward holineſſe, did ſeeme vnreproueable of theſe impious workes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were thought to bee exempted from the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: the Apoſtle directeth his ſtile againſt that fained holineſſe. And becauſe that viſarde before men, coulde not bee drawen from thoſe pettie ſaints: he reuoketh them vnto the iudgement of God, whoſe eyes beholde the verie hidden thoughts.</p>
            <p>Afterward hauing made a diſtribution, he citeth the Iewes
<pb facs="tcp:7612:10"/>
by themſelues, and the Gentiles alſo by themſelues before the tribunall ſeate of God. Hee taketh from the Gentiles that excuſe of ignorance, which they pretended. For their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whereby they were ſufficiently conuicted, was vnto them in ſteede of a lawe. Hee vrgeth the Iewes with that chiefly, which they tooke for their defence: namely, with the written law, wherof in as much they were proued to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, they could not cleare themſelues of iniquitie: ſeeing the mouth of God had alreadie pronounced ſentence againſt them. Hee preuenteth alſo that obiection which might ſeeme to make for them, <hi>videliz.</hi> that the couenant of God, which was vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the marke of ſanctification, was violated, vnleſſe there were difference put betweene them and others. Here, firſt he teacheth that the title of the couenant, made them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then others, ſeeing through their vnfaithfulneſſe they were fallen from it. Secondly, leaſt the conſtancie of gods promiſe ſhould be in any part diminiſhed, he graunteth vnto them ſome prerogatiue by the couenant: but ſuch as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the mercy of God, and not in their merite. Then final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the authoritie of the ſcripture, he proueth al both Iewes and Gentiles to bee ſinners: where alſo he ſpeaketh ſomwhat of the vſe of the law.</p>
            <p>Thus when he hath depriued all mankind both of the truſt of their own vertue, and alſo of the glory of righteouſnes, and throwen them downe with the ſeueritie of gods iudgement, he commeth vnto that which he purpoſed: namely, that wee are iuſtified by faith: ſhewing what faith that is, and howe wee obteine thereby the righteouſneſſe of Chriſte. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto hee addeth in the ende of the third Chapter, a ſinguler ſentence to beate downe the fiercenes of mans pride, leaſt he ſhould aduaunce himſelf againſt the grace of God. And alſo leaſt the Iewes ſhould hemme in the grace of God within the compaſſe of their nation, he proueth by the way that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the Gentiles alſo.</p>
            <p>In the 4. chap. he argueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an example, which, becauſe it was cleere and therefore free from cauillations, he putteth it downe: to wit, in Abraham, who, in as muche as hee is the father of the faithfull, ought too bee in ſteede
<pb facs="tcp:7612:11"/>
of a rule &amp; generall example. Hauing therfore proued him to be iuſtified by faith, he teacheth that the ſame way is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of vs,</p>
            <p>And heereupon hee inferreth, by the comparing of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to followe, that the righteouſneſſe of workes muſt vaniſh where place is giuen to the iuſtification of faith. Which thing he proueth by the teſtimonie of Dauid, who repoſing all the bleſſednes of man in the mercy of God, doth take this from works, that they ſhould make a man bleſſed.</p>
            <p>After this hee handeleth that more at large, whiche hee had briefly touched before: namely, that there is no cauſe why the Iewes ſhold aduance themſelues aboue the gentiles, who are partakers of the ſame felicitie with them, ſeeyng the Scripture declareth righteouſneſſe to haue happened vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham when hee was vncircumciſed. In which place hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occaſion to intreate of the vſe of circumciſion. After this he addeth that the promiſed ſaluation doth depend vpon the onely goodnes of God: for if it depended vpon the law, then could it neither bring peace vnto our conſciences, wherein it ought to be firmely rooted, neyther were it like euer to come vnto his perfection. Wherefore, that it may be firme and ſure, in imbracing of it, we are to conſider the onely truth of God, and not our ſelues: and that after the example of Abraham, who not conſidering himſelfe, did wholly ſet before him the power of God. In the ende of the Chapter, to the intent hee might more aptlye applye the alleadged example vnto the generall cauſe, hee conferreth thoſe thinges which on both ſides are like.</p>
            <p>In the fift Chapter, after he hath touched the fruite &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the righteouſnes of faith, he is almoſt wholly occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in amplifications, whiche ſerue to make the matter more cleere. For by an argument taken from the greater, he ſheweth how great things, we now being redeemed, &amp; reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, are to expect &amp; looke for at his hands through his loue: which was ſo bountiful towards vs being ſinners, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vndone. &amp; caſt away, that he gaue vnto vs his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; only beloued ſonne. After this he compareth ſinne with
<pb facs="tcp:7612:11"/>
righteouſnes which commeth by free grace, Chriſt with Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, death with life, the law with grace. Wherby he declareth that the infinite goodnes of God doth ouermatch our ſins, how great ſo euer they are.</p>
            <p>In the ſixte Chapter, hee commeth vnto ſanctification which we haue in Chriſt. For our fleſhe is prone, aſſoone as it hath taſted a little of this grace, to cocker wantonly his ſins, &amp; concupiſcences, as though it had now diſpatched al. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule on the contrary declareth here, that we cannot bee partakers of righteouſnes in Chriſt, vnleſſe alſo wee lay holde on ſanctification. Hee fetcheth his argument from Baptiſme, wherby we are admitted in the felowſhip of Chriſt: therin we are buried together with Chriſt, that being dead in our ſelues, by his life wee might be raiſed vnto newnes of life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it enſueth, that no man without regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can put on his righteouſnes. From hence he draweth exhortations vnto puritie, and holines of life, which neceſſarily ought to appeare in thoſe who are tranſlated from the power of ſinne, into the kingdome of righteouſnes, hauing caſt away the wicked coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering of the fleſh, which ſeeketh a more licentious libertie of ſinning in Chriſt. Finally, he doth briefly make mention of the abrogation of the law, in abrogating wherof the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made manifeſt, where, beſides the forgetting of ſin, the holy ſpirite is promiſed.</p>
            <p>In the 7. Chapter, he entreth into a moſt neceſſary diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vſe of the lawe, whiche hee had lightly by the waye touched before: giuing a reaſon why wee are looſed from the law, becauſe that by it ſelf, it had no power, but vnto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And leaſt this ſhould turne to the reproch of the law, he doth mightily cleare the lawe from all reproches. For he ſheweth that through our fault it came to paſſe, that the lawe which was giuen for life, was made the matter of death. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring alſo howe ſinne is encreaſed by it. From hence hee paſſeth to the deſcription of the fight between the ſpirite and the fleſh, which fight the children of God feele in themſelues, ſo long as they are ſhut within the priſon of this mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for they beare the reliques of concupiſcence, wherby they are continually drawen partly from the obedience of the law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7612:12"/>The eight chapter is full of conſolations, leaſt the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the faythfull being feared with that diſobedience which he reprooued before, or rather imperfect obedience, ſhould be ouerthrowne. But leaſt that the wicked ſhould take occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herby to flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, firſt he ſheweth that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit doth not appertein vnto any but vnto the regenerate, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpirit of God liueth &amp; is of force. Therefore he vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth two things: the firſt, that all thoſe which are graffed into the Lord Chriſt by his ſpirit, are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger, &amp; feare of condemnation, howſoeuer they are yet laden with ſinnes. Secondly that they which yet remain in the fleſh, without the ſpirit of ſanctification, are not partakers of this ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward he declareth howe great the certainetie of our truſt is, ſeeing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> ſpirit of God by his teſtimony doth driue away all douting and wauering. Moreouer by an anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preuenting he ſheweth that the aſſurance of eternall life ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be interrupted or diſturbed through the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, whereunto, for the time of this mortall life, we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: but rather by ſuch exerciſes, our ſaluation is furthered, vnto the excellencie whereof, if all the preſent miſeries bee compared, they are nothing. This thing he confirmeth by the example of Chriſt: Who as he is the firſt begotten, obteining the principalitie in the houſe of God, ſo he is the firſt paterne, whereunto we ought all of vs to be conformed. And therfore as vnto a thing moſt ſafe and ſure, hee addeth a notable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe, wherein he triumpheth couragiouſly againſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and engines of Satan.</p>
            <p>And for as much as many were greatly mooued, when they ſawe the Iewes which were the principall keepers, and heires of the couenat, to diſpiſe Chriſt: for thereby they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that eyther the couenant was tranſlated from the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Abraham, whiche contemned the keeping of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or els this was not the promiſed Sauiour, whiche proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not better for the people of the Iewes: he beginneth to meet with this obiection in the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the nienth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Hauing therefore firſt of all teſtified his goodwill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his countreymen the Iewes, that they might not think hee ſpake any thing of malice, and alſo hauing mentioned
<pb facs="tcp:7612:12"/>
thoſe ornaments whereby they excelled others, he deſcendeth eaſily to the taking away of that offence, which did ariſe of their cecitie or blindnes. And deuideth the ſonnes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham into two ſortes: that he might declare how that all thoſe which are borne of him according to the fleſhe, are not to bee reckoned in his ſeed, to participate the grace of the couenant. And on the contrary thoſe which are not borne of his ſeed, to be counted for ſonnes, if they be ingraffed by faith: Wherof he propoſeth an example in Iacob and Eſau. Therefore he calleth vs here, vnto the election of God, vpon the which, this whole matter muſt neceſſarily conſiſt and depend. Againe, ſeeing this election leaneth only vpon the mercie of God, in vayne is the cauſe thereof ſought for in the worthines of men. Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is contrary, which notwithſtanding it is moſt iuſt, yet is there no cauſe aboue the will of God. About the end of the chapter hee declareth by the teſtimonies of the Prophetes, both the calling of the Gentiles, and alſo the reprobation of the Iewes.</p>
            <p>In the tenth chapter, hauing begunne agayne with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of his good will towards the Iewes, he ſheweth that the vaine truſt of workes was the cauſe of their ruine. And leaſt they ſhoulde pretende excuſe by the lawe, hee preuenteth that, declaring, howe by the lawe wee are alſo led as it were by the hande, vnto the righteouſneſſe of faith. Adding that this righteouſneſſe, through the bountifulneſſe of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently offered vnto all nations: but yet to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thoſe onely, whom God hath lightened with his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace. And whereas moe Gentiles then Iewes are partakers of that bleſſing, he ſheweth that that alſo was foreſpoken of, by Moſes and Eſai: The one whereof propheſied playnely of the calling of the Gentiles, and the other of the hardening of the Iewes.</p>
            <p>Here yet remayned a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whither the couenant of god, put not ſome difference between the ſeede of Abraham, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations. Whiles he goeth about to ſatiſfie this queſtion, firſt he admoniſheth, that the worke of God is not to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto the ſight of the eye; ſeeing many times the elect paſſe our vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7612:13"/>Euen as in olde tyme Elias was deceiued, who thought that religion was vtterly periſhed among the Iſraelites, when as yet there were ſeuen thouſande aliue. Secondly, that we are not to be troubled with the multitude of vnbeleeuers whiche wee ſee abhorre the Goſpel. At the length hee affirmeth that the couenant of God abideth, yea euen in the poſteritie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham according to the fleſhe, but yet in thoſe, whom God according to his free election hath predeſtinated. Then he conuerteth his talk vnto the Gentiles, leaſt they growing too proude through their adoption, ſhoulde lift vp themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iewes as reprobates, when in the meane time they excell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in nothing, but in the fauourable acceptation of the Lorde: which ought rather to bee vnto them a cauſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. And the ſame alſo, is not vtterly departed from the ſeede of Abraham, for the Iewes at the length, by the fayth of the Gentiles, ſhall bee prouoked vnto emulation: that ſo GOD may gather vnto him all his Iſrael.</p>
            <p>The three Chapters following conteyne preceptes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions touching manners: but they are diuerſly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. The twelfth Chapter conteyneth generall preceptes concerning a chriſtian life. The thirteenth chapter for the moſt part is ſpent in eſtabliſhing the authoritie of Magiſtrats. Whereby wee may make a moſt certayn collection, that there were then ſome vnquiet perſons, which thought chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie coulde not ſtande, vnleſſe the ciuill power were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. But leaſt Paul ſhoulde ſeeme to impoſe any thing vpon the Church beſides the dueties of charitie: hee ſheweth that this obedience is alſo conteyned vnder charitie. After this hee addeth thoſe preceptes for the inſtruction of our life, whiche hee had not mentioned before.</p>
            <p>In the nexte chapter hee taketh on him an exhortation, which was very neceſſarie for the preſent tyme. For there were ſome, who, through obſtinate ſuperſtition, beeing addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the obſeruations of Moſes, could not without great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſuffer the neglect of them. Agayne, there were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, who being confirmed, touching the abrogation or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of them, whiles they went about to remooue ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
<pb facs="tcp:7612:13"/>
purpoſely ſhewed foorth a contempte of them.</p>
            <p>Both parties offended throughe vntemperatures. For the ſuperſtitious condemned the others, as contemners of the Lawe of GOD: and they agayne without diſcretion deſpiſed the ſimplicitie of the others.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Apoſtle putteth downe for them both a conuenient moderation: calling thoſe were ſtronge from pride and diſdayne, and thoſe were ſuperſtitious of infyrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and weakneſſe, from their too muche frowardneſſe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer hee preſcribeth a notable fourme of Chriſtian libertie, that it might conſiſte, within the boundes of Charitie, and edifycation: hee giueth thoſe are weake wholeſome counſayle, whiles hee forbiddeth them to attempt any thing agaynſt their conſcience.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth Chapter beginneth with a repetition of the geenerall ſentence, as the winding vp of the whole diſputation, that thoſe are ſtronge myght beſtowe their ſtrength to confyrme the weake.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there was a perpetuall ſtrife betweene the Iewes, and the Gentiles, about the ceremonies of Moſes, the materiall cauſe of pride beeing taken out of the way, hee endeth all the quarrell betweene them. For hee teacheth them, that the ſaluation of them both doth depende vpon the onelie mercie of GOD: whereunto they leaning, ought to lay downe all pride: and wherin they being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together in the hope of one inheritance, ought euerye way to imbrace one another.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he coueting to make a digreſſion vnto the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Apoſtleſhip, which brought great authoritie to his doctrine, taketh occaſion thereof whiles he exſcuſeth, and craueth pardon for his raſhneſſe, that he was ſo bolde to take vpon him the office of a teacher among them. Furthermore, hee putteth them in great hope of his commming, whiche thing hee ſaith in the beginning of this Epiſtle, hee had in vaine hitherto gone aboute, and prooued: and this hee doeth, adding the cauſe which preſently did hinder him:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7612:14"/>Namely that the Churches of Macedonia &amp; Achaia had committed to his charge, the carriage of that almes vnto Hieruſalem, which they had giuen to relieue the poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren there.</p>
            <p>The laſt Chapter ſtandeth wholly almoſt vppon ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but that it being heere and there tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with certayne preceptes not to be contemned, is concluded with an excellent prayer.</p>

The opinion of <hi>Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> is more probable,<note place="margin">Paule had two names.</note> who iudgeth him to haue had two names. For it is not vnlike, that this name Saule beyng a name of his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, was giuen vnto him of his parents, to declare his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and kinred: &amp; the other name Paul, to haue beene added for to teſtifie the title of the citie of Rome: both becauſe they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue this honour obſcured in him, whiche then was greatly eſteemed: neither made they ſuch reckoning of it, that it ſhould extinguiſhe the remembraunce of the ſtocke of Iſrael. That he vſeth the name of Paul oftener in his Epiſtles, this may ſeeme to be the cauſe, it was more famous, and more vſed in the Churches, vnto the which he wrote, it was more gracious in the Romaine Empyre, though leſſe knowne in his owne kinred. For it behooued him to haue great care to auoyde that vayne ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and hatred, wherin the very name of a Iewe was at that time with the Romaines, and Prouincials: and to beware hee increaſed not the madnes of his Countriemen, and to take heed to him ſelfe. <hi>A Seruaunt of Ieſus &amp;c.</hi> Hee adorneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with theſe titles,<note place="margin">Paule two wayes getteth authority to his doctrine.</note> that hee might gette authoritie vnto his doctrine. And that he doth two wayes: firſt, whiles hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his calling vnto the Apoſtleſhip. Secondly, when hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that the ſame calling is not ſtrange from the Churche of Rome. For it was both very expedient that he ſhould be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle by the calling of God, and alſo knowen to bee appoynted to the Church of Rome. Therefore he ſaith that he was a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, and called vnto the office of an Apoſtle: whereby he ſignifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did not raſhly intrude himſelf thither. Straight way after he ſaith, he was ſeparated or put apart: that hee might the better proue, he was no vulgare or common fellowe, but an excellent Apoſtle of the Lorde. In which ſignification he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7612:15"/>
before deſcended from the generall, vnto that was more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: ſeeyng that the Apoſtleſhippe is a kynde of miniſterye. For who ſo occupieth the function of teaching, is to be counted amongeſt the ſeruauntes of Chriſt: But Apoſtles, by degree of honour are moſt excellent amongeſt all others. This ſelection or putting a part whereof he ſpeaketh, doth declare both the end and vſe of the Apoſtleſhip. For his mynde is briefly to ſhewe, to what end he was called vnto this function. Therfore whereas he ſaith he was a ſeruaunt of Chriſt, that is common to him with al other teachers. In chalenging vnto himſelf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of an Apoſtle, he preferreth himſelfe before others: but becauſe he deſerueth no authority which intrudeth himſelfe, he admoniſheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of the Lord. The meaning is thus: that Paule is a ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt, not a common ſeruant, but an Apoſtle, and that not by intruſion, but by the calling of God. Then followeth a more cleare expoſition of the duety of an Apoſtle, namely that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined to the preaching of the Goſpel. For I am not of their mynd, which referre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> calling, wherof he ſpeaketh, vnto the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal election of God: by ſeparation or putting apart they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand eyther that whereby hee was ſeparated from his mothers wombe, wherof he ſpeaketh to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.15.</note> or that wherby Luke ſaith, he was appointed vnto the Gentiles. For ſimply he reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had God his author, leaſt any ſhould thinke he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly vſurped this honor.

Out of this place wee may geather what the Goſpel is: which he teacheth not to haue beene preached, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed by the Prophets. Therfore if the Prophets did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the Goſpel, it followeth then, that the Lorde being at the length manifeſted in the fleſh, it was exhibited: they are therfore deceiued that confound the promiſes with the Goſpell:<note place="margin">A difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and the promiſes.</note> ſeeyng the Goſpel properly is a ſolemne preaching of Chriſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, in whom the promiſes are exhibited.</p>

The promiſe made vnto Dauid, was ſo famous, that it is euident, by vſe to haue beene taken vp amongſt the Iewes, to cal the Meſſias the ſonne of Dauid.

                  <hi>9 For God is my witnes.</hi> He ſheweth his charitie by the effectes.

And becauſe he knew it was expedient for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing credit to his preaching, that the Romanes ſhould be wel perſwaded of his ſinceritie: he addeth an oth, A neceſſary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as often as that talke which ought to be firme and out of all doubte, is called into queſtion. For if an othe bee nothing elſe

then a calling of GOD to witneſſe, for the confirmation of our talke, they are verye fooliſhe whiche denye the Apoſtle to haue ſworne in this place, and yet notwithſtanding hee tranſgreſſed not the commaundement of Chriſt. Whereby appeareth that the meaning of Chriſt was not (as the ſuperſtitious Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes dreame) altogether to put downe othes,<note place="margin">An othe is not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> but rather to call vs vnto the true obſeruation of the lawe. And the lawe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth an othe, forbidding onely periurie, and ſuperfluous ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Therefore if we will, accordingly as wee ſhoulde, ſweare, let vs follow the ſobriety and reuerent diſcretion whiche appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">God is ſo called to witnes in an othe, that he is called to be a reuenger if we deceiue. 2. Cor. 1.23.</note> And to the ende thou mayeſt vnderſtand this rule, know thou, that GOD is ſo called to be a witneſſe, that hee is alſo called to bee a reuenger if wee doe deceiue. Whiche thinge Paule expreſſeth in another place in theſe woordes, Nowe I call God for a recorde vnto my ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom I woorſhippe in ſpirite.</hi> Becauſe wicked men whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che delude God, vſe no leſſe boldly then raſhely to pretende his name, Paule here commendeth his holineſſe, that hee might haue the more credite. For who ſo doeth feare, and reuerence God, will abhorre to ſweare falſly. Moreouer, he oppoſeth his ſpirite againſt outward hypocriſie. And becauſe many doe falſly boaſt themſelues to be the worſhippers of God,<note place="margin">Which is the true worſhip of God.</note> and in outwarde ſhewe appeare to be ſo, he teſtifieth that he doeth woorſhip God from his heart. It may be alſo hee had reſpect vnto the olde cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, in which onely, the Iewes thought the woorſhippe of God did conſiſt. Therefore he letteth to vnderſtand that although he reteyned not that exerciſe, yet neuertheleſſe hee was a true worſhipper of God:<note place="margin">Philip. 3.3.</note> as he ſaith vnto the Philippians. We are the true circumciſion, which ſerue God in the ſpirite, and glorie not in the fleſhe. Therefore he reioyceth that hee woorſhipped God in ſincere pietie of mynde, which is true religion, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawfull worſhip of God. It was expedient (as I ſaide before) to the ende his othe might haue the more certaintie, that Paule ſhould teſtifie his deuotion towardes God. For periurie which the godly abhorre more then a thouſand deathes,<note place="margin">Where true feare of God is, there is alſo a reuerence of his name.</note> is but a ſporte with the wicked. For it cannot be, but where there is a ſerious feare of God, there ſhoulde alſo be ſuch reuerence of his name. It is therefore as much as if Paule ſhoulde ſay, I knowe howe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7612:20"/>
great reuerence, and religious deuotion there ought to bee of an othe, I therefore doe not call God to witneſſe as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vſe to doe. And ſo by his example hee teacheth vs,<note place="margin">A rule to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in calling God to witnes.</note> that ſo often as wee ſwere, wee ſhoulde giue ſuch teſtimonie of holines, that the name of God which wee vſe in our talke might haue his weight. Secondly, hee proueth by the ſigne, that hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped not God hypocritically, namely by his miniſterie. For that was a notable token, that hee was a man giuen to the glory of God, who hauing denyed himſelfe, refuſed not for the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the kingdome of God, to ſuſteine what daungers ſoeuer, whether of reproche, pouertie, death, or hatred. Some vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this clauſe, as though he did therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend that worſhip, wherwithal he ſaid he worſhipped God, becauſe it was according to the preſcript rule of the Goſpell. Sure it is that the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worſhip of God, is commaunded in the Goſpell. But yet the former interpretation is muche more conſonant: namely, that hee bequeathed his obedience to God, in the preaching of the goſpell. Yet in the meane while hee diſtinguiſheth himſelfe from hypocrites, who haue another purpoſe then to ſerue God:<note place="margin">Hypocrites ſeek not God in the adminiſtration of their office.</note> as ambition or ſome ſuch like doth cauſe moſt of them, and it is farre to ſeeke, that all ſhoulde behaue themſelues ſincerely and faithfully in that office. The ſumme is, that Paule was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied ſincerely in the office of teaching: becauſe he applied that, which by the way of circumſtance hee had ſpoken of his pietie, vnto the preſent cauſe.<note place="margin">The preaching of the goſpel is a precious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto god.</note> But hence wee gather a profitable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which ought greatly to incourage the miniſters of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when they heare that they doe a thankfull and precious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto God, in preaching the goſpell. For what is it that ſhoulde hinder them, when they know their labour ſo to pleaſe God, and to bee approued with him, that it is counted an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſeruice of God? Moreouer hee calleth it the goſpell of the ſonne of God, becauſe Chriſte is manifeſted in it, beeing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined of the father vnto this, that whiles he is glorified, he ſhold againe glorifie the father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That without ceaſing.</hi> Yet hee expreſſeth a greater heate of loue, by his continuall praying. For it was much, alwayes to make mention of them, when hee made his prayers vnto God. And that wee may haue the ſenſe more plaine, I take this

                  </gap>, in ſteede of a nowne: as though it were ſaid, in all my prayers, or as often as I come vnto God in prayers, I make mention of you. And hee ſpeaketh not of euery inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God, but of thoſe praiers, whereunto whiles the ſaints will beſtow themſelues,<note place="margin">The godly haue vſed ſet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne prayers.</note> all cares being ſet a part, they giue their whole ſtudie to them. For oftentimes he mighte vpon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine burſt foorth into this or that wiſhe, and yet the Romans not in his remembrance: But as often as hee did purpoſely, and as it were with meditation pray vnto God, amongeſt others hee was alſo mindefull of them. Therefore hee ſpeaketh of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar prayers, whereunto the Saints doe purpoſely diſpoſe them ſelues: as wee ſee the Lorde himſelfe in ſuche prayers to haue ſought for a ſolitarie place. And withall he giueth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand howe often, or rather howe continually hee was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in them, whiles hee ſaith, hee prayed without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>

                  <hi>Beſeeching, that by ſome meanes.</hi> Becauſe it is not like, that from our heart wee ſeeke his profite, whome wee are not readie to further with our helpe: after hee hath declared his carefulneſſe in procuring their ſaluation, nowe hee addeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother argument whereby he teſtified before God, his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them: namely, in beſeeching that he might helpe them. Wherefore, that you may haue the full ſenſe, reade theſe words as though the worde <hi>yea</hi> were interpoſed: Yea, beſeeching, (that by ſome meanes.) And when hee ſaith, <hi>a proſperous iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the will of the Lorde,</hi> hee declareth that hee doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looke for the proſperitie of life from the fauour of the Lorde,<note place="margin">Al things ought to be counted proſperous which pleaſe God.</note> but euen thereupon to eſteeme his iourney proſperous, if it bee approued of the Lorde, according to which rule, all our deſires ought to be ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I deſire to ſee you, &amp;c.</hi> Hee might after a ſort being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, haue confirmed their faith with his doctrine: but becauſe counſaile is alwayes better taken of one preſent therefore he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted rather to bee with them face to face. And he ſheweth the ende of his counſaile, to ſignifie vnto them, that he would not take vpon him ſo weariſome a iourney for his owne, but for their profite. By ſpirituall giftes, hee vnderſtandeth eyther the giftes of doctrine, or exhortation, or propheſie: whiche
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7612:21"/>
hee knewe he had receyued of the grace of God. Here hee hath notably ſet forth the lawfull vſe of thoſe giftes, vnder the word,<note place="margin">The right vſe of Gods graces.</note> communicating or beſtowing. For to that ende are diuers gifts giuen peculiarly to euery one, that all might graciouſly one help another, and one make another partaker of thoſe thinges, which are giuen to euery one: of this afterward. <hi>To ſtrengthen you.</hi> Hee qualifieth that which hee ſayde of communication,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.3. &amp; 1. Cor. 12.11</note> leaſt hee ſhoulde ſeeme to count them ſuch, as were yet to bee inſtructed in the firſt elementes, as though they were not yet rightly entred in Chriſt. Therefore he ſaith that he coueteth to helpe them in that reſpect, wherein, they may yet be holpen, which haue profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greatly. For all of vs haue need to be confirmed,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.13.</note> till Chriſt be made perfect in vs. And not beyng content to haue ſpoken ſo modeſtly, he addeth ouer and beſides, a caſtigation or correction, wherein hee ſheweth that he did not ſo take vpon him the office of teaching, but that alſo hee coueted to learne againe of them. As if he ſhoulde ſay, I deſire ſo to confirme you according to the meaſure of grace giuen vnto me, that my faith alſo, by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may be incouraged: and ſo we may profite one another amongſt our ſelues. Beholde into howe great moderation this godly man ſubmitteth him ſelfe, that he refuſeth not to ſeeke for confirmation of thoſe were but rawe ſchollers.</p>
               <p>Neither ſpeaketh hee diſſemblingly.<note place="margin">None is inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſuche plentie of Gods graces, but hee may ſome time reape profite by the ſimpleſt.</note> For there is none in the Church of Chriſt ſo voyde of giftes, that hee can not profite vs ſomewhat: but our malignitie and pride hinder vs, that wee doe not receiue any ſuch commoditie. Wee are ſo high minded, and dronken with fooliſhe glorie, that diſpiſing others, and ſetting them at nought, euery man thinketh him ſelfe to be ſufficient i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him ſelf. I had rather reade it with Bucer by the way of exhortation, then of conſolation: becauſe ſo it agreeth better with the premiſſes.</p>

               <p>Whereas hitherto he had teſtified that hee did continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God that he might at ſome time ſee them,<note place="margin">The counſailes and purpoſes, yea euen of the godly are many times interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> becauſe that might ſeeme to bee but a vayne thing, vnleſſe hee woulde take occaſion offered, nowe he certified them in that point: for hee ſayth there was no want of will but of opportunitie: becauſe he was often interrupted of his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Where we learne, that the Lorde many times ouerthroweth the counſailes of his Saintes, that he might humble them, and by ſuch humbling, teache them to haue reſpecte vnto his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they might depende vpon it, although the Saintes, who deliberate nothing without the will of God, are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driuen from their counſailes. For that is wicked boldneſſe without regarde of God to determine vpon thinges to come, as who ſhoulde ſay, they were in our power: whiche boldeneſſe, Iames reproueth ſharpely.<note place="margin">Iacob. 4.13.</note> Whereas he ſaith he was <hi>letted,</hi> thou mayeſt not otherwiſe take it, then that the Lorde did lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him more vrgent buſines of the Church,<note place="margin">The godly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments as the godles doe.</note> which he coulde not leaue without great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage to the Churche. Thus y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentes of the godly and faithles differ: that theſe thinke them ſelues then at length to be letted, when by the violent hande of the Lorde they are ſo hemmed in, that they can not ſturre them ſelues: the other are content to take ſome lawefull reaſon for an impediment: neither doe they permit them ſelues to attempt any thing, eyther beſides their office or contrary to edification. <hi>That I might haue ſome fruite.</hi> Vndoubtedly he ſpeaketh of that fruite, to the gathering whereof the Apoſtles were ſent of the Lorde:<note place="margin">Io. 15.16.</note> I haue choſen you, that ye might go, and bring foorth fruite, and your fruite might remaine. Which fruite albeit hee gathered it not for himſelfe,<note place="margin">Gods glorie &amp; the felicitie of the godly are ioyned together</note> but for the Lord, yet he calleth it his: becauſe there is nothing more proper vnto the godly, then that which aduaunceth the glory of the Lorde, wherevnto all their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie is coupled.

For it pleaſed the Lord to ſend him alſo vnto the wiſe.</p>
               <p>Two thinges are here to be conſidered.

For if Paule were indebted to them, and is to bee thought to haue beene a faithfull debtor, vndoubtedlye hee perfourmed that whiche he ought. Wherefore heere they ſhall finde, whereof they may bee capable to inioye it. Here alſo all Teachers haue a rule which they may followe, namely, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, and courteouſly they humble them ſelues to the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and idiotes.

                  <hi>17 For the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> This is an expoſition &amp; confirmation of the former ſentence, namely,<note place="margin">Saluation is life with god.</note> that the Goſpel is the power of God vnto ſaluation, For if wee ſeeke for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:7612:24"/>
that is to ſay, life with God, firſt wee muſt ſeeke for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Without righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, there is no life.</note> whereby wee beeyng reconciled vnto GOD, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his mercie maye obtayne life, whiche conſiſteth onelye in his beneuolence. For ſeeyng God hateth vnrighteouſneſſe, we muſte needes bee righteous before wee cann bee loued of him. Therefore he ſignifieth that wee canne not obteyne ſaluation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere then in the Goſpell: becauſe GOD doeth not elſe where manifeſt vnto vs his righteouſneſſe, whiche onelye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth vs from deſtruction. And this righteouſneſſe whiche is the groundworke of our ſaluation is reuealed in the Goſpell: whereupon the Goſpell is called the power of God vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So he reaſoneth from the cauſe vnto the effect. Moreouer, note how rare and precious a treaſure the Lorde doeth beſtowe vppon vs in the Goſpell, namely, the communication of his righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">Righteouſnes of God, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is approued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</note> By the righteouſneſſe of God I vnderſtande that righteouſneſſe which is approued before the tribunall ſeate of God: as on the contrary he is woont to call that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, which in the opinion of men is reckoned and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for righteouſneſſe, although indeede it bee but a ſmoake. And yet I doubt not but Paule alludeth vnto manye Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, where the ſpirite of God often celebrateth the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in the kingdome of Chriſt to come. Others expound it for righteouſneſſe which is giuen vnto vs of God. And ſurely I confeſſe the wordes will beare this ſence: becauſe God doeth iuſtifie vs by the Goſpel: therefore he ſaueth. Yet that former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation ſeemeth vnto me to be more agreeyng: Although I doe not greatly ſtande vppon that matter. That is more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where ſome thinke this righteouſneſſe doth not onelye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the free remiſſion of ſinnes: but partly alſo in the grace of regeneration. But I doe vnderſtand it, that we are therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored into life, becauſe God hath freely reconciled vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: as we ſhall ſhewe more at large afterwarde in his place. And whereas he ſaide before to <hi>euery one that beleeueth,</hi> now he ſaith <hi>from faith:</hi> for righteouſnes is offered by the Goſpel, &amp; is receiued by faith.<note place="margin">Righteouſnes is offered in the Goſpel, and is receiued by faith.</note> And he addeth to <hi>faith:</hi> for looke how much our faith increaſeth in vs, &amp; how much we haue profited in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by ſo much the righteouſneſſe of God together with them is augmented in vs, &amp; after a ſort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſſeſſion therof is eſtabliſhed.

As ſoone as wee doe taſte of the Goſpell, wee ſee the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of GOD, but a farre off, fauourable and pleaſant tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes vs: the more that the knowledge of pietie groweth in vs,<note place="margin">As faith and knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel increaſe, ſo the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in vs.</note> as it were by comming neerer, wee beholde the grace of God more cleare and more familiarly. Whereas many thinke there is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe wordes a ſecrete comparing of the olde with the newe Teſtament, that is more ſubtile then firme. For Paule do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not here compare the fathers whiche liued vnder the Lawe with vs, but noteth the daylye progreſſe and proceeding in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye faithfull man. <hi>As it is written.</hi> By the authoritie of the Prophete Habacuc hee prooueth this righteouſneſſe of fayth. For hee, when hee prophecieth the deſtruction of the proude, addeth alſo, that the life of the iuſt conſiſteth in fayth. And wee liue not in the ſight of GOD but by righteouſneſſe: Therefore it followeth that our righteouſneſſe alſo doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vppon faith. And the verbe future noteth the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall perpetuitie of that life whereof hee ſpeaketh: as if hee hadde ſayde, it is not momentaney, but ſhall endure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For the wicked alſo are proude through a falſe opinion of life: but whiles they ſaye <hi>peace</hi> and all is well,<note place="margin">1.

Whence is that, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fayth doeth bringe vs vnto GOD, and ſetleth our life in him? For vnleſſe this were the meaninge of the Prophete, that then, and not before, wee ſtande, when by fayth wee leane vppon GOD, Paule had not aptlye applyed this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. And vndoubtedly hee hath not otherwiſe aſcribed the life of the Godly vnto fayth, but ſo farre as, the pryde of the worlde beeyng condemned, they gather them ſelues vnder the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of one God. Hee doeth not nowe vppon ſette purpoſe handle this cauſe: and therefore hee maketh no mention of free righteouſneſſe: but euen by the nature of fayth it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlye apparaunt, that this teſtimonye is fittely applyed vnto the preſent cauſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, by this diſputation wee doe neceſſarily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mutuall relation betweene faith and the Goſpell.

Concerning that interpretation which I
<pb facs="tcp:7612:28"/>
refuſe, my reaſon is at hande that maketh agaynſt it: becauſe this errour of fayning an Image to GOD, hadde not his originall from the Phyloſophers, but they hauinge receyued it of others with their ſentence did approoue it.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <hi>23 And they turned.</hi> After they had faygned God to bee ſuche one, as they coulde apprehende by their carnall ſence, it was farre from them to acknowledge the true God: but they made a faigned and newe GOD, or rather an image in the ſteede of God. That is it hee ſayeth, <hi>They turned the glorye of the Lorde:</hi> becauſe like as if a manne ſhoulde ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orne, or put a ſtraunge childe in the place of the naturall, ſo they departed from the true God. Neyther doeth this pretence excuſe them, that yet notwithſtanding they beleeued GOD dwelled in heauen: and that they counted not the wood for God, but for an Image: For euen this ſame is contumelious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,<note place="margin">It is great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely againſt God to imagin ſo groſely of him, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him to a mortall, yea or immortall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.</note> that they imagined ſo groſely of his Maieſtye, that they durſt make vnto him an image.

This madneſſe therefore is noted, that all woulde fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure God vnto them ſelues, which thing vndoubtedly declareth their groſſe and fooliſhe imaginations of God.

Of the manner howe God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth giue menne ouer vnto wickedneſſe, it is not neceſſarye I ſhoulde make anye large diſcourſe in this place. For it is

                  <hi>26 For this cauſe GOD gaue them vppe.</hi> As though hee hadde interpoſed a Parentheſis, hee returneth vnto that whiche hee hadde begunne before, concerninge the reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of the Lorde: and hee bringeth the firſte example, in the horrible ſinne of prepoſterous luſte: Whereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth they were not onely giuen ouer too beaſtlye luſtes: but alſo became woorſe then beaſtes, when they ouerthrewe the whole order of nature.

Whereas hee ſaith they <hi>approued not,</hi> it is as much as if hee ſhoulde ſay, they followed not the knowledge of God with ſuch ſtudie as they ought, but rather purpoſely they turned their cogitation from God: Hee ſignifieth therefore that through their wicked election they preferred their owne vanities before God: and ſo that errour wherewith they were deceiued, was voluntarie. <hi>To doe thoſe things which are not conuenient.</hi> Becauſe hitherto he hath mentioned onely that one execrable example, which though it were common amongſt many, yet it was not common vnto all, hee beginneth to recken ſuche vices as no man coulde bee founde to bee free of.

               <p>Moreouer, they labour in vaine whiche goe aboute to reduce theſe vices into an order, that one mighte bee drawen out of another: ſeeing that was not the purpoſe of Paule,

but to ſet them downe as euery one came firſte to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce. What euery of them ſignifieth, let vs briefly runne ouer them. Vnderſtande iniuſtice, when the right of humanitie is violated amongeſt men, in not giuing to euerie one that is his, <hi>Ponerian</hi> according to the ſentence of <hi>Ammonius</hi> I haue turned lewdneſſe or vngraciouſneſſe.

Lewdnſſe therefore or vngraciouſneſſe is a practiſed or exerciſed kinde of wickedneſſe, or a more looſe licenſe of committing naughtines. As for maliciouſneſſe, it is that prauitie and crokedneſſe of the minde whiche ſtriueth to doe harme to our neighbours. Where Paule hath the woorde <hi>Porneian,</hi> I haue put this woorde luſte, yet I am not againſte it if any man had rather tranſlate it forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: for it ſignifieth as well the inwarde luſte, as the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall action.

               <p>For this is the head of all miſchief, when as the ſinner is ſo paſt all ſhame, that hee both flattereth his owne ſinnes (neither will hee haue it diſliked in him) and alſo by his conſent and cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring doth nouriſh them in others.

Item, ſhee hath ſpreade her feete abroade and gloried in her wickedneſſe.<note place="margin">Pro. 2.14. Ezech. 16.25.</note> For hee whiche is yet aſhamed is curable. But when through the cuſtome of ſinning ſuche impudencie is contracted, that vices pleaſe, and are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſteede of vertues, there is no hope of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.

The Gentiles pretended excuſe by ignoraunce: the Iewes gloried in the title of the Lawe, from the Gentiles hee taketh all excuſe and hafting, and the Iewes hee ſpoyleth of their falſe and vaine boaſting.

For ſo they declare howe they are not ignoraunt that God is to be worſhipped: adulterie, theft, and murder, are euill: and honeſtie is commendable. Neither is it meteriall what kind of god they imagine to be, or how many gods they make: it is ſufficient that they vnderſtande there is a God, and that the ſame is to be honoured and worſhipped. It forceth not whether they permitte the concupiſcence of another mans wife and poſſeſſion, or any other thing: whether they can

But becauſe the greateſt part of bookes is againſt it, and the ſence may ſtand otherwiſe, I keepe the olde reading, eſpecially ſeeing it is but a ſmall matter of one particle. Now therefore hauing diſpatched the cauſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he returneth vnto the Iewes: and to the ende he might more vehemently beate downe all their vanitie, he graunteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all thoſe thinges, wherewithall they were proude and puffed vp. Secondly, he ſheweth how little they ſerue to vaine glory: yea, rather howe greatly they ſerue to their reproche. Vnder the name of Iewe, hee comprehendeth all the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of that nation, whiche being taken from the lawe and the Prophetes, they did falſly pretend, and ſo he vnderſtandeth al the Iſraelites, who were at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indifferently called Iewes.</p>

Albeit I ſee this ſentence is probable, yet if there bee any whome it ſatiſfieth not, I will bring alſo of my ſelfe another coniecture. It ſeemeth verily vnto mee to bee like, that when they were ſo waſted and ſcattered, they could not conſerue any certayne diſtinction of tribes. For neither could the ceſſing, valuing or muſtering of the people be done in ſeaſon: neither did the policie or decent forme of gouerning their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth ſtande, (which was neceſſarie for conſeruing ſuche order) they both dwelt, ſpearced, and ſcattered out of order: and alſo being worne with aduerſities:<note place="margin">When &amp; whence the Iſraelites were called Iewes.</note> they were not ſo carefull for the reckoning of their kinred.

Whither therefore they would foreſee that was to come, or they would ſalue the preſent euill, I thinke they altogether went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of that tribe, wherein purity of religion had abidden longeſt, which tribe by ſinguler prerogatiue excelled all the reſt, and out of the whiche they looked for the redeemer to come. For this was their refuge in extremities, to comforte themſelues with looking for the Meſſias.

This is not the glorying of the hearte, but the bragging of the tongue.</p>

And that is diligently to bee noted. For if hee ſhoulde intreate of the whole nature, and propertie of circumciſion, it were abſurde that there ſhould be no mention of grace &amp; free promiſe.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7612:42"/>
he anſwereth, that if the worke be reſpected in circumciſion, this is the condition of it, that hee which is circumciſed, giue himſelfe to worſhip God wholy, and perfectly: the worke therefore of circumſion is perfection. And thus wee may ſpeake of our baptiſme. If any truſting in the only confidence of the water of baptiſme, doth thinke himſelfe to bee iuſtified, as though hee had nowe gotten holineſſe by that worke: the ende of baptiſme is to bee obiected: namely that by that the Lorde doth call vs vnto holyneſſe of life. Heere ſhoulde the promiſe and grace, whiche baptiſme doth teſtifie, and ſeale vnto vs, be paſſed ouer in ſilence: becauſe we are to deale with thoſe, who being content with the vaine ſhadowe of baptiſme, they care not, nor conſider not that which is the principall in it. And this verily you are to note in Paule, when hee ſpeaketh of ſignes or Sacramentes to the faithfull, and not by contention or concrouerſie, that his manner is to conioyne them with the efficacie, and accompliſhmente of their promiſes: when hee hath to deale with ouerthwart and fooliſh interpreters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignes or ſacraments, then omitting to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proper &amp; true nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignes or ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, he direc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth his whole ſtile againſt their corrupt interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny becauſe they ſee Paul bringeth circumciſion rather then any other worke of the lawe, doe thinke that hee taketh away righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe from the ceremonies only. But it is farre otherwiſe. For this thing is wont alwayes to follow, that they which dare ſet their merites againſt the righteouſneſſe of God, glory more in externall obſeruations, then in ſounde vertues For who ſo is truely touched and moued with the feare of God: dare neuer lift vp his eyes to heauen, for the more hee ſhall ſtriue vnto true righteouſneſſe, the better hee ſhall ſee howe farre he is from it. As for the Phariſees, who thinke it enough to ſhadowe their holineſſe with externall hypocriſie, it is no maruel though they ſo eaſily flatter themſelues. Therefore Paule when hee had left the Iewes nothing but this poore ſhift, that they ſhould boaſt them themſelues to be iuſtified by <hi>circumciſion,</hi> he nowe alſo taketh from them this vaine viſour.</p>

                  <hi>3 For what if ſome, &amp;c.</hi> As before, whiles hee reſpected the Iewes, glorying in the bare ſigne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee did not graunt vnto them ſo much as a ſparke of glory: ſo nowe whiles hee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the nature of the ſigne, hee teſtifieth that the vertue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not aboliſhed, no not through their vanitie. Becauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſeemed aboue to import, that if there were any grace in the ſigne of circumciſion, it were all periſhed through the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnes of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Nowe againe, by the way of exception or ſubiection, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth what is to be thought thereof. And here is a kinde of ſilence or concealing: becauſe hee expreſſeth leſſe then hee woulde haue to bee vnderſtood: for he might truely haue ſaide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great part of the people had caſt from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the couenant of the Lorde: but becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had beene marueilous bitter in the eares of the Iewes, that hee might mittigate the roughneſſe thereof, hee only nameth ſome. <hi>Shall their incredulitie, &amp;c. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>targein,</hi>
                  </hi> properly is to make voide, and of none effect: which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification is moſte apt for this preſent ſentence. For Paule entreateth not onely whether the incredulitie of men can let the veritie of God, that it ſhoulde not remaine firme and ſtable in it ſelfe: but whether it can hinder the effect and accompliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente thereof amongeſt men. The meaning therefore is, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt of the Iewes were couenant breakers, whether through their vnfaithfulneſſe the couenant of God be ſo abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it ſhoulde ſhewe foorth no fruite amongeſt them? hee anſwereth, that it cannot come to paſſe through the prauitie of men, that the veritie or truth of God ſhoulde not haue his conſtancie.</p>
               <p>Therefore howeſoeuer the greateſt part hath broken the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, and troade it vnder foote, yet notwithſtanding it retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his efficacie,<note place="margin">There were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people of the Iewes in whom the couenant of God was effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</note> and exerciſeth his force: though not in euery one, yet at the leaſte in the ſame nation. And efficacie, or force is this, that the grace and bleſſing of the Lorde might bee of ſtrengthe amongeſt them vnto eternall ſaluation.</p>
               <p>And that cannot bee but where the promiſe is receiued by faith, for ſo the mutuall couenaunt is confirmed on both ſides. Therefore hee ſignifieth, that there were alway ſome
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7612:45"/>
in that nation who abyding in the faith of the promiſe, did not fall from that prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let God be true.</hi> Howſoeuer others thinke, I take it to be an argument from the neceſſary ſequele of the contrarye, whereby Paule diſſolueth the former obiection For if theſe two ſtande together, (yea doe neceſſarily agree) that God is true, and man a lyar: it followeth, that the truth of God is not letted through the lye of men. For except hee did nowe oppoſe one of theſe principles againſt the other, in vayne, and to no purpoſe is hee ſtraightwayes ſo ſerious in refuting this inconuenience, namely, how God may be righteous, if he ſet foorth his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by our vnrighteouſneſſe. Wherefore the meaning is playne, that the faith of God is ſo farre from being deſtroyed or ouerthrowen by the vnfaithfulneſſe and default of men, that it appeareth more cleere or excellent. <hi>He calleth God true,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How God is true.</note> not onely becauſe he is readye to ſtande faithfully vnto his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but alſo becauſe whatſoeuer he ſaith in worde he fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ſame indeede, for he ſo ſpeaketh that his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſtraight brought into acte. On the contrary, manne is called a Lyar, not onely becauſe hee oftentimes breaketh his promiſe but becauſe by nature hee coueteth leaſing,<note place="margin">How man is a lyar.</note> and fleeth the trueth. The former member is a ſpeciall Maxime of Chriſtian Phyloſophie. The later is taken out of the Pſalmes, where Dauid confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.11.</note> there neyther commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye certainetye from manne, neyther is there anye in him.</p>
               <p>This place is notable, and conteyneth verye neceſſarye conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: for ſuche is the peruerſitie of menne in refuſing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the worde of GOD, that the certainty thereof ſhoulde often come into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except it came to our remembrance that the trueth of God dependeth not vppon mans veritye. But howe agreeth this with that was ſayde immediatelye before, namelye, that the faith of men whiche may receyue the promiſe,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> is required that the promiſe of GOD might bee effectuall? For fayth is contrarye vnto lyinge. It ſeemeth to bee an harde queſtion, yet it is eaſily reſolued: to witte, that the Lorde by the lyes of men, (whiche otherwiſe are hynderaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnto his trueth) will yet fynde vnto him ſelfe a waye where there is no waye, that hee may ouercome,<note place="margin">Anſweare.</note> by

correcting in his elect that incredulitie is graffed in our nature, and by ſubiecting into his obedience ſuche as doe ſeeme to bee vnruly. Finally nowe the diſputation is of the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and nor of the grace of God, which is the remedy of the ſaid corruption. <hi>That thou mighteſt be iuſtified.</hi> The meaning is, it is ſo farre off that the truth of God ſhould be deſtroyed by our lie and vnfaithfulneſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> that thereby it is made more apparant and manifeſt, As Dauid teſtifieth ſaying, that therefore becauſe hee was a ſinner, God was alwaye a iuſt, and righteous iudge, what ſoeuer he decreed againſt him: and that he ſhoulde ouercome all the reproches of the wicked, which would murmure againſt his righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">By ſayings are meant iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> 
                  <hi>By the ſayinges of God.</hi> Dauid vnderſtandeth iudgementes which he bringeth foorth againſt vs. For whereas they commonly expound it of the promiſes, that is too muche wreſted. Therefore this particle <hi>that,</hi> is not only finall, neither noteth a conſequence farre fetched, but is of as much value as an illation, Inferring or bringing in, to this ſence: I haue ſinned againſt thee, therefore thou maiſt by right puniſh me. And that Paul hath alleadged the place of Dauid in his proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſence the obiection added a little after doth proue, how ſhall the righteouſneſſe of God abyde perfect, if our iniquity ſette it foorth? For in vayne (as I haue partly ſhewed a little before) and out of ſeaſon ſhould Paule ſtay the readers vpon this doubt, except Dauid did vnderſtand that God by his wonderfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doeth get prayſe vnto his righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities of men by their owne nature ſerue to the diſhonour of God &amp; ſubuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his truth: Yet by his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he getteth vnto himſelfe glorie thence, and therby eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth his trueth.</note> euen out of the iniquities of men. The ſecond member after the Hebrew is thus, and thou <hi>in iudging pure,</hi> which ſpeech importeth nothing elſe, then that God is woorthy of prayſe in all his iudgements, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the wicked exclayme, and odiouſly goe about by their complayninges to ouerwhelme his glory. But Paule followed the Greeke tranſlation which ſerued better for the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For we know the Apoſtles in recyting the wordes of the Scripture to be more franke, free, or bold: becauſe they counted it ſufficient if they applyed them vnto the matter. Wherefore they ſtoode not ſo muche vppon the wordes. Vnto the preſente place therefore this ſhalbe the application, if all the ſinnes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men muſt ſerue to the ſetting forth of the glorie of the Lord: &amp; he is ſpecially glorified by his truth: it followeth that the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

of men ſerueth rather to the eſtabliſhing, then ſubuerting of his truth: And albeit this worde <hi>Crinesthai</hi> may bee taken as well actiuely as paſſiuely: yet I doubt not but the Grecians haue tranſlated it paſſiuelye beſides the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>

For ſeeing woorkes are ſo farre foorth iuſt in the ſight of the Lorde, as wee doe ſtudie by them to giue vnto him woorſhippe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: to the ende hee might more preciſely take from all woorkes the force, vertue, or ſtrength of iuſtification, hee hath named thoſe woorkes whiche ſpecially myght iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, if there were any that coulde iuſtifie.<note place="margin">Workes of the law are named by a kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, as who ſhould ſay, if they iuſtifie not then no workes iuſtifie.</note> For it is the lawe that hath the promiſes, without the which our woorkes are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewe before God. Thou ſeeſt therefore the cauſe why Paule expreſſed the workes of the lawe: Namely, becauſe by the law there is a rewarde appointed vnto woorkes. Neyther were the very Scholemen ignoraunt hereof: amongſt whome it is an olde and common ſaying, that workes are not meritorious in reſpect of any internall or reall worthineſſe, but for the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And although they are deceiued, for that they ſee not our woorkes alwayes to bee defiled with vices, which doe take from them merite: yet that principle is true, namely, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of workes dependeth vpon the voluntary promiſe of the lawe.</p>
               <p>Therefore Paul wiſely and very well doeth not diſpute of bare woorkes: but preciſely and namely hee alleageth the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the lawe, of the which properly the queſtion was. As for thoſe thinges which are brought in of other learned men for the defence of that ſentence, they are weaker then were meete.</p>
               <p>By the naming of <hi>circumciſion,</hi> they thinke an example to bee propounded, which prooueth that it appertaineth vnto the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies onely. But wee haue alreadie declared why Paule hath named circumciſion. For neither doe any other ſwell with the confidence of workes then hypocrites. And wee know howe they glorye onely in eternall ſhewes. Secondely, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in their iudgement was a certayne entraunce vnto the righteouſneſſe of the lawe: therefore it ſeemed alſo to bee a woorke of great dignitie. And whereas they fight out of the Epiſtle to the Galathians: where, when Paule handleth the ſame cauſe, yet hee directeth his ſtile vnto ceremonies onely:
<pb facs="tcp:7612:52"/>
that alſo is not firme inough to obtaine that they woulde. Sure it is, Paul had to doe with ſuch as did inſence the people with a falſe beleeue or confidence of ceremonies. That he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue or take this away hee doeth not conteine him ſelfe within the compaſſe of ceremonies, neither diſputeth hee ſpecially of what valewe they are: but he comprehendeth the whole lawe, as may appeare by the places whiche are all of them deriued from that fountaine.<note place="margin">Paul ſpeaketh here of workes without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Suche alſo was the ſtate of that diſputation which was holden at Hieruſalem amongſt the diſciples. And it is not without cauſe we laboure to prooue Paul in this place without exception to ſpeake of the whole lawe. For the verye ſtile and maner of diſputation which hee hath hither to followed and doeth ſtill proſecute, doeth ſufficiently fauour vs: and many places doe not ſuffer vs to thinke otherwiſe. It is therefore a ſentence notable amongſt the chiefeſt, that no man ſhall bee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the keeping of the lawe. Hee hath ſhewed the reaſon before, and repeateth it againe ſtraightwayes: becauſe all men together being conuicted of tranſgreſſion, are reprooued of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe by the lawe.<note place="margin">Fleſh without ſome ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man.</note> Theſe two are contrary one to the other (as wee ſhall ſee more at large in the proceſſe) to bee thought righteous by workes, and to be guiltie of tranſgreſſion. This worde <hi>fleſhe</hi> without any ſpeciall conſideration betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth men: but that it ſeemeth after a ſort to pretende a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſignification. After which maner more is expreſſed when one ſayth all mortall men, or all mortall creatures, then if hee ſhoulde name all men, as you may ſee with or at <hi>Gellius. For by the Lawe.</hi> Hee reaſoneth from the contrarie, that we haue not righteouſneſſe by the Lawe, becauſe it conuinceth vs of ſinne and damnation: ſeeing life and death proceede not foorth of the ſame fountaine. And whereas he reaſoneth from the contrary effect of the lawe, that wee can not be iuſtified by it: wee muſte vnderſtande, his argument proceedeth or holdeth not, except wee keepe this as an inſeparable,<note place="margin">Though the law be the rule of righteouſnes, yet it profiteth nothing, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupcion.</note> &amp; perpetuall accident, that the lawe reuealing to man his ſinne, taketh from him the hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that way.

For it may not bee referred vnto doctrine, which ſtraightwayes hee citeth for the witneſſe of free righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by faith. Where as ſome reſtraine it vnto ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſhortly after I ſhall ſhewe that to bee vayne and colde. It remayneth therefore that we knowe the merite of workes to be excluded. Where alſo wee ſee howe hee mixeth not woorkes with the mercie of God: But all opinion of workes being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued and aboliſhed, he eſtabliſheth the onely mercie of God. Neither am I ignorant that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth expounde it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for he taketh the righteouſnes of God for the grace of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: and hee confeſſeth this grace to bee free, becauſe the Lorde reneweth vs, being vnworthie, with his ſpirite. And from this hee excludeth the workes of the lawe, that is, whereby men goe about, without renouation, of them ſelues in deſerue God. And I knowe well inough, that certaine newe beholders and vewers of matters doe arrogantly pronounce this doctrine, as
<pb facs="tcp:7612:53"/>
though it were at this day reueiled vnto them. But it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare plainely by the text howe the Apoſtle without exception comprehendeth all woorkes,<note place="margin">All workes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, yea euen thoſe god worketh in vs.</note> yea thoſe which the Lorde woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his. For ſurely Abraham was regenerate, and was led by the ſpirite of God, at ſuch tyme as hee denieth him to bee iuſtified by workes. Therefore he excludeth from the iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, not onely thoſe workes which are morrally good (as commonly they terme them) and which are done by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of nature, but alſo what woorkes ſo euer the faithfull can haue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if that bee the definition of the righteouſneſſe of faith, bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiuen: the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not of this or that kinde of woorkes: but the merite of workes being done away, onely remiſſion of ſinnes is put downe for the cauſe of righteouſneſſe. They thinke theſe two agree well, man to bee iuſtified by faith by the grace of Chriſt: and yet notwithſtanding to bee iuſtified by woorkes which doe proceede from ſpirtuall regeneration: becauſe both God doeth freely renewe, and by faith wee receiue his gift.

Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth no merite of workes can bee admitted in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith. Whereby appeareth it is but a friuelous cauill that wee are iuſtified in Chriſt, becauſe wee are renewed by the ſpirite as wee are the members of Chriſt: that wee are iuſtified by faith, becauſe by faith wee are graffed into the bodie of Chriſt: that wee are iuſtified freely, becauſe GOD doeth finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vs but ſinne.</p>

And when Paule ſayeth GOD iuſtifieth men by not imputing their ſinnes, hee reciteth that Sermon which ought dayly to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in the Church.</p>
               <p>And that part of the conſcience which is troubled in reſpect of woorkes, is not of the continuaunce of one day, but ought to laſte the whole life: whereby it followeth,<note place="margin">No beginning proceeding, or perfection of righteouſnes but in Chriſt onely.</note> wee are not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe iuſtified, euen vntill the day of death: but becauſe wee haue reſpecte vnto Chriſte onely, in whome GOD hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted vs, and nowe holdeth vs acceptable.

Therefore the ſence ſhall be, after Chriſt was

Then they peruert the lawe, who wreſt it vnto that ende. Moreouer, if thou doeſt deſire the proofe of this ſentence, proſecute in order the ſumme of Moſes doctrine, and thou ſhalt finde, howe man at the beginning being caſt from the kingdome of God, had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtitution then in the Euangelicall promiſes touching the bleſſed ſeede, wherein the breaking of the Serpentes head is forſpoken: And wherein a bleſſing is promiſed or denounced to all nations.

                  <hi>23 For there is no difference.</hi> Hee inioyneth vnto all without exception the neceſſitye of ſeeking righteouſneſſe in Chriſte: as if he ſhoulde ſaye, there is no other way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne righteouſneſſe by, neither are ſome iuſtified this way, and other ſome that way, But all together by faith, becauſe all are ſinners: and therefore they haue not whereon to glorie with God. And he taketh it for a thing graunted, that when menne are come vnto the tribunall of God, whoſoeuer is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of ſinne in his owne conſcience, hee lyeth confounded, and ſo ouerthrowen vnder his owne ignominie: that no ſinner can abyde the face of God, as we ſee in the example of Adam. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne he fighteth with an argument taken from the contrarye: where wee muſt marke what followeth. Becauſe all menne are ſinners, Paule inferreth, that they want or are depriued of the prayſe of righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">All glory of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes taken from men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſinners.</note> Therefore according to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine there is no righteouſneſſe but that is perfect and abſolute. For if there were any halfe righteouſneſſe, then ſhoulde not he is a ſinner be altogether ſpoyled of all glorye. Whereby that fable of righteouſneſſe in parte (as they call it) is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently refelled. For if it were true, that wee are partly iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by woorkes, and partly by the grace of God: This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paule ſhoulde be of no force,<note place="margin">Where ſinne is there is no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, vntil Chriſt haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the curſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</note> namely, that all are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depriued of the glory of God, becauſe they are ſinners. It is therefore out of all controuerſie, there is no righteouſneſſe there, where ſinne is, till Chriſt haue put away the curſe. And that is it, is ſayde to the Galathians: As many as are vnder the lawe, are ſubiect to the curſe: but we are deliuered from this by the benefite of Chriſt. By the <hi>glorie of God,</hi> he vnderſtandeth that glory which hath place before God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.43.</note> as it is ſaid with Iohn, they haue loued more the glory of men, then the glorye of God.

                  <hi>And are iuſtified freely.</hi> The Participle after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Grecians is put in ſteede of the verbe. The meaning

is, becauſe there remayneth nothing els vnto men in themſelues, but that they beeyng ſmitten thorow by the iuſte iudgement of God ſhoulde periſhe: therefore they are iuſtified freelye by his mercie. For Chriſt helpeth this miſery, and doeth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelfe to the faithfull, that in him onely they maye finde all thinges whiche are wanting vnto them. As it falleth out, there is no place in all the Scripture more notable to ſet foorth the power of this righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">The efficient materiall, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and finall cauſe of our iuſtification.</note> For it ſheweth the mercy of God to be the efficient cauſe: Chriſt with his blood to be the matter or materiall cauſe: Faith conceyued by the woorde, to be the formall or inſtrumentall cauſe: Laſtly, the glory both of the iuſtice &amp; goodnes of God to be the final cauſe. Concerning the efficient cauſe, hee ſayeth wee are iuſtified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that verely by his grace. Therefore by this he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth howe all is of God and nothing of our ſelues. It might haue beene ſufficient to haue oppoſed grace vnto merites: but leaſt wee ſhoulde imagine an halfe righteouſneſſe, hauing added a repetition hee doeth more clearelye ſhewe foorth his mynde: and hath aſcribed the true effect of righteouſneſſe to the onelye mercy of God, which righteouſneſſe the Sophiſters rent in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and mayme, leaſt they ſhould be conſtrayned to confeſſe their owne pouerty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the redemption.</hi> The matter of our righteouſneſſe or iuſtification is, that Chriſte by his obedyence hath ſatiſfied the iudgement of the Father, and by taking our perſon vppon him, hath deliuered vs from the tyrannye of death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we were holden captiue. For by the ſatiſfaction of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he offered, our guiltines is taken away. Wherby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the imagination of thoſe is notably refelled,<note place="margin">Righteouſnes is not a quality in vs.</note> which will haue righteouſneſſe to be a quality in vs. For if we be therfore reputed righteous before God, becauſe we are bought or redeemed by a price: then ſurely wee borowe that elſe where, which is not in our ſelues. And ſtraight wayes Paule declareth of what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er this redemption is, and whereunto it ſerueth, namely, that we might be reconciled to God. For he calleth Chriſt the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or rather (which liketh vs better, that we might allude vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the olde figure) the propitiatory. And what els ſignifieth that, but that we are iuſte, ſo farre foorth as Chriſte reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

the father to vs? But now it behoueth to conſider the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom God foreappoynted. &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe the Greeke worde <hi>Protithenai,</hi> ſometime ſignifieth to determine or appoynt afore, ſometime to bring foorth into light: if the firſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be taken, Paule referreth it vnto the free mercy of God, that Chriſt was foreordayned a mediatour, whiche ſhould recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the father to vs by the ſacrifice of his death. And this is an excellent commendation of grace, that God did willingly of him ſelfe ſeeke out a meane, whereby he might take away our curſe. And certaynly this place ſeemeth to agree with that of Iohn: God ſo loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten ſonne. Howbeit if we imbrace the other ſence, the ſame reaſon ſhall ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: that God in his tyme made him manifeſt, whom he had decreed with himſelfe to be the mediatour. In the worde propitiatory I think there is an alluſion (as I ſaid) vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old propiciatory. For he teacheth how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is exhibited in Chriſt indeede, which was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there. Yet becauſe the other opinion cannot be diſproued, if any had rather vnderſtand it more ſimply, I will leaue it to their election. The meaning of Paule in this place may ſurely be gathered out of his wordes,<note place="margin">Without Chriſt God is alway angry with vs.</note> namely, that God without Chriſt is alway angry with vs: and that we are reconciled by him, whiles by his righteouſneſſe we are accepted. For God doth not deteſt in vs his owne workemanſhip: but our vncleanneſſe, which hath extinguiſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of his image: which vncleannes when the waſhing or rinſing of Chriſt hath done away, he loueth and imbraceth vs as his owne pure workmanſhip. A <hi>Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> or <hi>reconciliation through his blood.</hi> So I had rather worde for worde to keepe that Paule hath:<note place="margin">When the blood of Chriſt is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of our redemption be not excluded but vnderſtood by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> which is when by a parte the whole is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</note> for verily he ſeemeth vnto me by a continuall ſtile without interruption to ſay, God is reconciled vnto vs, ſo ſoone as we haue our confidence repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the blood of Chriſt: becauſe through faith we come into the poſſeſſion of his benefite. Whiles he nameth <hi>blood</hi> only, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not the other partes of our redemption: But rather vnder a parte hee comprehendeth the whole ſumme: And named the blood, wherein we haue our waſhing. So by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure <hi>Synecdoche</hi> the whole cleanſing is noted. For whereas he ſaid of late that God was pleaſed with vs in Chriſt, nowe hee addeth, that the ſame is brought to paſſe by fayth:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7612:56"/>
and alſo what our faith ought chiefly reſpect in Chriſt. <hi>For the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> The prepoſition <hi>cauſall</hi> is as much in value, as if he had ſaide, for forgiueneſſe ſake, or to this ende that he might doe away ſinnes. And this definition or expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth confirme agayne that which I haue nowe already ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie tymes warned, namely, that men are not iuſtified becauſe they are ſuche indeede, but by imputation. Onely he vſeth he vſeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers woordes that he might more euidently declare, there is no merite of ours in this righteouſneſſe. For if we obteyne it by the remiſſion of ſinnes, we gather, it is out of our ſelues. Secondly, if the remiſſion of ſinnes bee of the meere liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of God, all merite falleth to the grounde. Yet heere ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a queſtion, why he reſtrayneth pardon or forgiueneſſe to the ſinnes are <hi>paſſed.</hi> Although this place be diuerſly expounded: It ſeemeth probable to me, that Paule had regarde vnto the cleanſinges or waſhinges of the lawe. Whiche were onelye te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the ſatiſfaction to come. For they coulde not pleaſe God. There is the like place to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note> that through Chriſte came the redemption of ſinnes that were in the former Teſtament. And yet thou mayſt not vnderſtande it, that no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions but thoſe of the former tyme are done awaye by the death of Chriſte. Whiche dotage or folly, ſome certayne mad men haue drawen from this place being vndecently wreſted.<note place="margin">There neuer was, is, nor ſhal be, any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction for ſinne then the blood of Chriſt.</note> For Paule onely ſheweth, that vntill the death of Chriſt there was no price to pleaſe God, and that the ſame was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed or fulfilled by the figures of the lawe: Wherefore the veritye vntill the fulneſſe of time, was in ſuſpence. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the ſame reaſon is of thoſe ſinnes doe daily make vs guyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye: for there is one onely ſatiſfaction for all. Some, that they might auoyde that inconuenience, haue ſayde the former ſinnes were forgiuen, leaſt a liberty of ſinning afterward ſhould ſeeme to be graunted. And true it is, there is no remiſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen but to ſinnes committed. Not that the fruite of redemption doth fall away or periſh, if afterwarde we ſinne, as <hi>Nouatus</hi> with his ſect did dreame:<note place="margin">Chriſtes death not onely auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable for ſins paſt, but alſo if hereafter we fal.</note> but becauſe this is the diſpenſation of the Goſpell, to ſet before him is about to ſinne, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wrath of GOD, and before him hath ſinned, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

Moreouer, if the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of workes be ſo taken away by faith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith cannot purely be preached, but in giuing all vnto the mercie of God, man muſt needes bee ſpoyled of all prayſe: it followeth then, that wee are not holpen by any woorkes to the obteyning of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Of woorkes?</hi> How doth the Apoſtle here deny our merits to be excluded by the lawe, ſeeyng before he proued our damnation out of the lawe? For if the lawe make vs ſubiecte to death, what glorie ſhall wee gette out of it? Or rather doeth it not couer vs, beeyng depriued of all glorye, with ſhame or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche? But then hee ſhewed, howe our ſinne is layd open by the detection of the Lawe, becauſe wee are all fallen from the obſeruation of it. And heere hee meaneth, if righteouſneſſe were in the lawe of woorkes, our glorying were not excluded:

And the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or contrarietye of fayth and woorkes is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: wherein without addition woorkes are put vniuerſally. Therefore, he neyther intreateth of ceremonies onelye, nor yet of the externall ſhew of woorkes: but comprehendeth all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of woorkes which can be imagined. The name <hi>Lawe</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto fayth improperly: but yet this darkeneth not the ſence of the Apoſtle. For his meaning is, that when wee are once come vnto the rule of faith, then all the glorie of woorkes is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen: as if hee ſhoulde ſaye, the righteouſneſſe of woorkes veryly is commended in the lawe, but faith hath a lawe of his owne, which leaueth no righteouſneſſe in workes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be.</p>
               <p n="28">
                  <hi>28 We haue determined therefore.</hi> Now he gathereth the principall propoſition, as though it were now out of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, adding alſo an explication. For iuſtification by faith is made very cleere, whiles woorkes are excluded by name. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our aduerſaries at this day labour nothing more, then that faith might be intangled with the merite of workes. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a man is iuſtified by faith: but not by ſole faith. Yea in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede they place the power of iuſtification in charity, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in wordes they giue it vnto fayth. But Paule in this place doeth make iuſtification ſo free, that he maketh it euident howe in no ſort it can ſtand with any merite of workes. I haue ſhewed before why he nameth the workes of the lawe: and alſo I haue declared thoſe to be ridiculous whiche reſtrayne it vnto ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Their imagination alſo is childiſh which take the works of the lawe for externall or literal workes, which are done without the ſpirite of Chriſt But rather the <hi>Epitheton</hi> is as much of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue as if he had called them meritorious:<note place="margin">How S.

It is therefore a groſſe fallacie: not to obſerue how the word <hi>iuſtifie</hi> or <hi>iuſtifying,</hi> is otherwiſe taken with Iames then with Paule: as they intreate of diuers things.

The promiſe indeede of ſeede or poſterity to come is there rehearſed, but yet which was grounded vpon the free adoption. And we
<pb facs="tcp:7612:61"/>
are to note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither ſaluation is promiſed without the grace of God, nor yet the grace of God without ſaluation. Agayne, we are neither called into the grace of God, nor into the hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but righteouſnes is alſo offered This being ſet downe, we may ſee they holde not the principles of diuinity, which think the teſtimony of Moſes to bee violently wreſted of Paule. For becauſe there is there a particular promiſe, they vnderſtand Abraham to haue done right and well, in that he beleeued it, and that he was ſo farre foorth approued of God. But therein they are deceiued, firſt in that they marke not, how that word <hi>beleeue,</hi> is extended vnto the whole content: wherefore it ought not to be reſtrayned vnto one member. And the chiefeſt errour is, that they beginne not at the teſtimony of the grace of God. But this doth God that he might aſſure Abraham both of his adoption, &amp; fatherly fauour: vnder which, eternall ſaluation by Chriſt is conteyned. Wherefore Abraham in beleeuing imbraceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but grace offered vnto him, that his faith ſhoulde not bee voyde. If this be imputed vnto him for righteouſneſſe, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth he was iuſtified no otherwiſe, but becauſe hee truſting in the goodneſſe of God, durſt hope for all thinges from him. Neither doth Moſes ſay what men thought of him: but how he was accounted before the iudgement ſeate of God. Abraham therefore apprehended the grace of God offered vnto him in the promiſe, wherein he felt righteouſneſſe to bee communicated to him. It is neceſſary for the eſtabliſhing of righteouſneſſe to know this relation betweene the promiſe and faith: for there is here the ſame reaſon betweene God and vs,<note place="margin">There is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene faith &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe, ſuch as is betweene the giuer and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</note> that is with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers betweene the giuer and him to whom the thing is giuen. For we doe not otherwiſe obteyne righteouſneſſe, but becauſe as it is offered vnto vs in the promiſe of the Goſpel, ſo we do by faith as it were, ſee the poſſeſſion of it. How the place of Iames whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſeemeth to bee muche contrary vnto this, is to be reconciled, I haue already ſhewed. And there (meaning the Epiſtle of Iames) I ſhall (by the leaue of God) declare it more at large.<note place="margin">They only are iuſtified to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righteouſnes is imputed.</note> Onely let vs note, that they to whom righteouſnes is imputed are iuſtified:</p>

                  <hi>4 For to him that worketh.</hi> He calleth him a worker, not euery one that is addicted vnto good woorkes, whiche ſtudie ought to flooriſh in all the ſonnes of God:<note place="margin">Who is called a worker, &amp; who a non worker.</note> but him that deſerueth ſome thing by his merites: likewiſe he counteth him a non wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or one that woorketh not, to whom nothing is due by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of workes. Neither is his meaning that he woulde haue the faithfull vprofitable, or idle Loyterers: but hee forbiddeth them onely to be hirelinges, who whatſoeuer they aſke of God, they craue it as of right due vnto them. And we haue already admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, how the queſtion is not here, after what ſorte we ſhould frame our life, but the queſtion is of the cauſe of ſaluation. And he reaſoneth from the contrary, that God doth not pay vnto vs righteouſneſſe as of debt: but doth frankly giue it vnto vs, that we might aſcribe it to him. And I truely am of <hi>Bucers</hi> mynde, who ſheweth the forme of reaſoning, not to be drawen from one worde, but from an whole ſentence, after this manner, if there be any that meriteth any thing by his work, the thing merited is not imputed vnto him of grace: but is payde vnto him as of debt or duetie. Faith is counted vnto righteouſneſſe, not as though it brought anye merite from vs,<note place="margin">How faith is counted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.</note> but becauſe it apprehendeth the goodneſſe of God. Therefore is righteouſneſſe no debt vnto vs, but giuen vs freely.

that no manne is iuſtified by the law it is euident, for the iuſt by faith ſhall liue. But the law is not of faith: but he that ſhall doe theſe, ſhall liue in them. For becauſe the lawe promiſeth wages vnto workes, therupon he concludeth the righteouſnes of faith which is free, not to agree with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of works.

For there is nothinge leſſe reaſonable, then to take
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7612:62"/>
the power or force of iuſtification away from ceremonies onely, ſeeing Paule doeth indefinitely exclude workes. Heereunto apperteyneth the contrary member, that God doeth iuſtifie men by not imputing their ſinne. In whiche woordes alſo wee are taught, that righteouſneſſe, with Paule is nothing els then the remiſſion of ſinnes. Laſtly that this remiſſion is free, becauſe it is imputed without woorkes: which the verie name of remiſſion ſheweth. For that creditoure or lendour whiche is paide doeth not remitte: but hee which willingly of meere li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie doeth cancell or raſe out the debte. Away nowe with thoſe teach vs to redeeme pardon of our ſinnes by ſatiſfactions: from which remiſſion of ſinnes Paule fetcheth an argument to eſtabliſhe the free gift of righteouſnes. For howe is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhoulde agree with Paule? they ſay, by woorkes wee muſt ſatiſfie the iuſtice of God, that wee may obtayne pardon of our ſinnes. On the contrary Paule reaſoneth, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of fayth is free and without workes: becauſe it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the remiſſion of ſinnes. This were vndoubtedly a falſe argument, if in the remiſſion of ſinnes there were any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or reſpect vnto woorkes at all. In like ſort by the ſame wordes of the prophete, the follie of the Schole men is refuted touching halfe remiſſion. They babble that the fault being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the puniſhment is reteined of God: but the Prophete he crieth that our ſinnes are not onely couered, that is, taken awaye in the ſight of God: but alſo hee addeth they are not imputed.</p>
               <p>How ſhall God take puniſhment of thoſe ſinnes hee doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute? therefore there remaineth ſound vnto vs,<note place="margin">God forgiueth not onely the fault, but alſo the puniſhment.</note> this moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſentence, he is iuſtified by faith, who is purged or clenſed before God by the free remiſſion of his ſinnes. Moreouer hence may be gathered the perpetuall continuance of free righteouſnes or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification through the whole life. For when Dauid being weri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the continuall ſting of his conſcience, burſt foorth into this ſaying, he ſpake ſurely by his owne experience. And now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he had ſerued God many yeeres.

<pb facs="tcp:7612:63"/>
our ſinnes. Whereby the imagination of thoſe is verye well refuted, which dreame that the righteouſneſſe of faith, is but the entrance, ſo that the faithfull by woorkes retayne the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of righteouſnes,<note place="margin">Righteouſnes not only begun but alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by faith.</note> which righteouſnes they did not obteyne by any merites. Where as ſome times workes are ſaide to be imputed vnto righteouſnes, and alſo other beatitudes are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that doth nothing preiudice the ſentence of Paul. The <hi>pſal.. 106.30.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 106.30.</note> ſaith it was imputed for righteouſnes vnto <hi>Phinees</hi> the prieſt of the Lorde, that in taking puniſhment vpon the adulterer and the harlot, hee tooke away the reproche of Iſraell. In deede we heare in this place howe a man did a good woorke: but wee knowe a man is not iuſtified for one deede. For there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a perfect and moſt abſolute obedience, as the promiſe ſaith: He that ſhall doe theſe ſhall liue in them.<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.5.</note> Howe then is this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Phinees</hi> imputed vnto him for rigteouſneſſe? ſurely it muſt needes bee, he was iuſtified before by the grace of God. For they which haue put on the righteouſnes of Chriſt, haue God not onely fauourable to them ſelues,<note place="margin">How righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is ſometime giuen vnto workes.</note> but alſo to their woorkes: whoſe ſpots &amp; moles are couered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puritie of Chriſt, that they come not into iudgement: whereby workes being infected with no corruptions are counted iuſt: and that no woorke of man can any otherwiſe then by this fauour pleaſe God, it is euident. And if the righteouſnes of faith be the onely cauſe why our works are counted iuſt: ſee then how ſottiſhly they reaſon, becauſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is giuen to workes, it is not of faith onely. But I oppoſe an inuincible argument againſt them, namely, that all works are condemned for vnrighteous, except a man be iuſtified by ſole faith. The like is to be vnderſtood of bleſſednes: they are denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bleſſed which feare the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 128.1. Pſal. 1.2.</note> and walke in his wayes. Which meditate in his law day and night: but becauſe no man doth that, in ſuch perfection as were meete, that the commaundement of God might be fully ſatiſfied, al ſuch bleſſednes is voide, &amp; of none effect, vntill that we being purified and clenſed by the remiſſion of ſinnes, be made bleſſed: and ſo are made capable of that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which the Lord promiſeth for his ſeruants for the ſtudie of the Lawe and good workes. Therefore both righteouſneſſe of workes, is an effect of the righteouſneſſe of fayth: and the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe commeth of workes, an effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſednes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remiſſion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7612:63"/>
of ſinnes. If the cauſe neither ought, neither can be deſtroyed of his effect, they goe ill fauouredly to woorke, if any goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ouerthrowe the righteouſneſſe of fayth by workes. But why may not a man (will ſome ſay) by thoſe teſtimonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proue a man to bee iuſtified and alſo made bleſſed through woorkes?<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> for the woordes of the Scripture ſay no more that a man is iuſtified by faith, and made bleſſed by the mercie of God, then by workes. Verily here as well the order of cauſes, as the diſpenſation of the grace of God is to bee conſidered.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what ſo euer is ſpoken either of the righteouſnes or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes of workes, it taketh no place, vnles this ſole righteouſnes of faith goe before, and onely fulfill all partes: this muſt be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp and eſtabliſhed, that the other as fruite from a tree may growe and come forth of it.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>9</bibl> Came this bleſſedneſſe then vpon the circumciſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or vpon the vncircumciſion alſo? for wee ſay that faith was imputed vnto Abraham for righteouſnes.</q>
               <q>
                  <bibl>10</bibl> Howe was it then imputed? when he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or vncircumciſed? not when he was circumciſed, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was vncircumciſed.</q>
               <p>Becauſe there is mention made of circumciſion and vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion onely, ſome fooliſhly gather, there is nothing els in queſtion, then, that righteouſneſſe is not obtayned by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the lawe. But wee are to note with what ſorte of men Paul hath to deale. For wee knowe that hypocrites, whiles in generall they boaſt their meritorious workes, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende a colour in externall workes. The Iewes alſo which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the groſſe abuſe of the lawe were alienated from true and perfect righteouſneſſe, had their peculier reaſon. Paul ſaide no man is bleſſed but he whom God by his free mercie reconcileth to himſelf: whereby it foloweth all they are curſed whoſe works come into iudgement. Now this principle is holden, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not iuſtified by their worthines, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of God. But yet that is not inough, except remiſſion of ſinnes go before al works, of the which circumciſion is the firſt, whereby the people of the
<pb facs="tcp:7612:64"/>
Iewes were ingraffed into the obedience of God. Wherefore hee goeth on in ſhewing that alſo. Wee are alwayes to beare this one thing in minde, that circumciſion is reckoned here as the inceptiue worke (if I may ſo terme it) of the legall righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">How the Iewes gloried in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</note> For the Iewes did not glorie in it, as in the pledge or ſeale of the grace of God, but as in a meritorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation or keeping of the lawe. Therefore they preferred themſelues before others, as though they were more excellent then others in the ſight of God. Nowe wee ſee the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is not of one rite: but vnder one kind are all the workes of the lawe, that is, all workes to the which wages can be due, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. And for this cauſe chiefly is circumciſion named, becauſe it was the foundation of legall righteouſneſſe. <hi>But</hi> Paul diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the contrary, if the righteouſneſſe of Abraham bee the remiſſion of ſinnes (which he bodily taketh for a thing granted) and the ſame remiſſion of ſinnes came vnto Abraham before cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: then it followeth, the remiſſion of ſinnes was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in regard of merites going before. Thou ſeeſt it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the order of the cauſes and the effects. For the cauſe is euer before his effecte.

that it is not the cauſe of righteouſneſſe. For it tendeth vnto the confirmation of the righteouſneſſe of fayth, yea and of that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which was had in vncircumciſion: therefore it derogateth or taketh nothing from it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, heere wee haue a notable place, concerning the common vſe of Sacramentes:<note place="margin">The common vſe of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> for they are (as Paule witneſſeth) ſeales, whereby both the promiſes of GOD are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort ſealed in our heartes, and the certitude of the grace of GOD eſtabliſhed. And although they profite nothing by them ſelues, yet GOD who woulde haue them to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes of his grace, doeth make that they wante not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete grace, and profite in the electe. And although they are vnto the reprobate only dead &amp; vnprofitable figures, yet they alwaies retaine their vertue &amp; nature: for albeit our incredulitie depriue vs of their effecte, yet it ſhaketh not, neither extinguiſheth the trueth of God. Wherefore let vs ſtande ſure, that the holy Sacramentes are teſtimonies, wherewithall God ſealeth his grace in our heartes. Touching the Sacramente of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion this is to bee ſaide in particular, therein was a twofoulde grace repreſented. GOD promiſed to Abraham a bleſſed ſeede, wherein both hee and all the worlde ſhould hope for health. Heerevpon depended that promiſe: I will bee thy GOD.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> Therefore the free reconciliation in GOD was included in that ſigne: and the analogie or proportion ſerued, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full might reſpect the promiſed ſeede. Againe, God required integritie and holineſſe of life: by the Sacrament hee declared howe it might bee come vnto: namely, if in man that bee cutte off, whatſoeuer commeth of the fleſhe, becauſe the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is corrupted. By the externall ſigne therefore hee admoniſhed Abraham, that he ſhoulde ſpiritually circumciſe the corruption of his fleſh, wherevnto alſo Moſes alluded.<note place="margin">Deut. 10.16.</note> And that he might ſhewe it was not the woorke of man but of God: hee wold haue tender infants circumciſed, who for want of yeres cold not as yet execute that commaundement. For, that ſpirituall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is an effect or worke of the celeſtiall power, Moſes hath ſpoken, as you haue in <hi>Deut:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 30.6.</note> The Lorde ſhall circumciſe thy heart. The Prophetes alſo afterwarde declared the verie ſame more clearely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:65"/>Finally, as at this day baptiſme, ſo in olde time circumciſion conſiſted of two partes: namely, that therein was teſtified as well newneſſe of life,<note place="margin">As circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in old time, ſo baptiſme at this day, is a ſigne of a twofold grace, namely, of the remiſſion of ſinnes and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</note> as the remiſſion of ſinnes: but where as in the perſon of Abraham circumciſion was after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that houldeth not alwaye in the Sacraments: as it appeareth in Iſaac and his poſterite: but GOD woulde once at the beginning ſhewe foorth ſuch an example, leaſt any ſhoulde tye ſaluation vnto the externall ſignes. <hi>That hee might bee the father.</hi> Note howe the circumciſion of Abraham confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our faith concerning free righteouſneſſe: for it is a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the righteouſneſſe of faith, that to vs alſo whiche doe beleeue, righteouſneſſe might bee imputed. And ſo, verie artificially Paule returneth thoſe thinges vpon the aduerſaries, which might bee obiected of them. For if the trueth and vertue of circumciſion, bee founde in vncircumciſion: there is no cauſe why the Iewes ſhoulde ſo greately aduaunce them ſelues aboue the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing a doubt might ariſe, whether wee alſo after the example of Abraham are not to confirme the ſame righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by the ſeale of circumciſion?<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> why did the Apoſtle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte it?<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> Namely, becauſe hee thought the queſtion to haue beene ſufficiently anſwered by his woordes. For ſeeing this ſentence is admitted, that circumciſion ſerueth onely to ſeale the grace of GOD: it followeth that at this day it were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous for vs, who haue another Sacramente ordayned of the Lorde in place thereof. Becauſe therefore where baptiſme is, there is no vſe nowe of circumciſion, hee woulde not to no purpoſe diſpute of that, whereof was no queſtion at all, to witte, why the righteouſneſſe of faith ſhoulde not be ſealed in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by circumciſion, if they ſhoulde bee like vnto Abraham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To beleeue by vncircumciſion.</hi> Is, that the Gentiles bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with their eſtate, are not to interpoſe the ſeale of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. And ſo this prepoſition <hi>dia,</hi> by, is put in ſteade of <hi>en,</hi> in.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7612:65"/>
in it. As for the other, which is the principall, they neglected it, namely, that they ſhoulde imitate the fayth of Abraham, by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che onely he obteyned health.<note place="margin">The circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iewes were not otherwiſe iuſtified then as they beleeued the promiſe of grace.</note> Hereby may appeare how ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he diſcerneth faith from the Sacrament: not onely leaſt anye ſhould content him ſelfe with this, without the other, meaning with the Sacrament without fayth, as though it were ſufficient to iuſtification: but alſo that the ſame fayth onely might fulfill all partes. For whiles hee confeſſeth the Iewes whiche are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to be iuſtified, he doth preciſely except, ſo that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Abraham abyde in fayth onely. For what ſhoulde be the meaning of faith in vncircumciſion, but that hee might ſhewe, faith onely without any helpe elſewhere to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? It is therefore to bee taken heede of leaſt any man by deuiding or parting in halfes, mixte together two cauſes of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. By the ſame argument the ſchoole diuinitie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted, touching the difference of the Sacraments of the old and new teſtament: for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe they take away the power of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, to theſe they giue it. But if Paule reaſon orderly, whiles he proueth that circumciſion iuſtifieth not, becauſe Abraham was iuſtified by faith: the ſame reaſon is alſo of ſtrength with vs: that we may denie men to be iuſtified by baptiſme, ſeeing they are iuſtified by the ſame faith, by the whiche Abraham was iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>

               <p>Furthermore the imagination of thoſe, which would haue this to bee ſpoken of ceremonies, is eaſely refuted: becauſe if workes brought any thing vnto iuſtification, then hee ſhoulde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue ſayde not by the written lawe, but by the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:66"/>But Paule doth not oppoſe ſpiritual holineſſe of life againſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but faith and his righteouſneſſe. The ſumme therefore is, the inheritaunce was promiſed to Abraham, not becauſe he had deſerued it by keeping the law, but becauſe by fayth he had obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned righteouſneſſe. And ſurely (as Paule ſtraightwayes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) then doe the conſciences of men inioye perfect peace, when they feele that to be freely giuen them, which is not due vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by right.<note place="margin">Saluation in Chriſt apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth no leſſe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles then vnto the Iewes.</note> Hereuppon alſo it followeth, that the benefite is no leſſe common to the Gentiles then to the Iewes, the cauſe of which benefit doth equally appertayne vnto both. For if mens ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be founded vpon the onely goodneſſe of God, they reſtrayne and hynder the courſe thereof as much as in them lyeth, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Gentiles from it. <hi>That hee might bee the heyre of the worlde.</hi> Seeyng eternall ſaluation is nowe in hand, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſeemeth out of ſeaſon to carry the readers vnto the world.

                  </note> Indeede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of life was the principall: yet it behooued that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed ſtate of the whole worlde ſhoulde be repayred.

And becauſe vnder the type of the land of Chanaan, not onlye the hope of eternall life was propoſed vnto Abraham, but alſo the full and perfect bleſſing of God: the Apoſtle very aptly teacheth that the dominion of the worlde was promiſed vnto him. The godly in this preſent life haue a certaine taſte hereof: becauſe howſoeuer they are at diuers times pynched with pouertye, yet, for that with a quiet conſcience they participate thoſe thinges which God hath created to their vſe,<note place="margin">Pouertie let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not, but the faithfull may be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heyres of the world.</note> and with his fauour and will inioye the earthly bleſſinges, as pledges and earneſt pennyes of eternall life, pouerty is no let vnto them, wherefore they ſhoulde not acknowledge heauen, earth, and the Sea to belong vnto them.</p>
               <p>The wicked albeit they heape vppe the riches of the worlde, they canne call nothing theirs: but rather they get them by ſtealth, becauſe they vſe them with the curſe of God. And it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7612:66"/>
great comforte to the godlye in their pouerty, that though they liue poorely, yet they ſteale nothing from any: but they receyue theyr lawfull commons or allowaunce at the hande of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye father, vntil they ſee the full poſſeſſion of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, when all creatures ſhall ſerue for their glorye.

                  <hi>14 For if they whiche are of the lawe.</hi> By an argument taken from that is impoſſible or abſurde, hee proueth that that grace which Abraham obteined of God, was not promiſed vnto him in regarde of the Legall part, or in reſpect of workes: for if this condition had beene interpoſed, that God woulde vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to adopt thoſe onely whiche deſerue it, or which keepe the lawe, no man ſhoulde haue durſt to beleeue that it apperteineth vnto him. For what man findeth ſuche perfection in himſelfe, that hee dare reſolue himſelfe, the inheritaunce is due vnto him by righteouſneſſe of the lawe? Then were faith made voide: becauſe an impoſſible condition doeth not onely holde the mindes of men in ſuſpence, and maketh them doubtfull, but alſo doth ſmite them with feare and trembling. So the effect of the promiſes ſhoulde vaniſhe away, becauſe they profite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except they be receiued by faith. If our aduerſaries had eares to hearken to this one reaſon,<note place="margin">If ſaluation were grounded vpon the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the law then neither ſhould mens conſciences bee at peace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promiſe haue effect.</note> then ſhoulde the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene them and vs eaſely come to an ende. The Apoſtle taketh it for a thing out of all queſtion, that the promiſes of God can not be effectuall, except we receiue them with ſure affiaunce of minde. And what ſhould come to paſſe if the ſaluation of man were grounded vpon the keeping of the lawe? the conſciences ſhoulde haue no certaynetie, but beeing vexed with a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:7612:67"/>
vnquietneſſe at length ſhal fall to deſperation. The promiſe alſo whoſe performance dependeth vppon an impoſſible thing, ſhoulde vaniſhe away without fruite. Let them goe now whiche teache the wretched people, to ſaue themſelues by works: ſeeing Paule doth plainly pronounce, that the promiſe is made of none effect, if it depend vpon workes. But that is very neceſſary to be knowen, faith is made voyde, if it ſtand vpon workes. For therby we both learne what faith is, and what kynde of righteouſneſſe, that righteouſneſſe of workes ought to be, whereunto men may boldly truſt. The Apoſtle teacheth that faith doth periſhe, vnleſſe the ſoule reſt ſecurely in the goodneſſe of God: faith then, is not either a naked knowledge of God or of his truth,<note place="margin">What faith is.</note> neither a ſimple perſwaſion that God is, that his worde is trueth it ſelfe: but a ſure knowledge of the mercie of God conceiued by the Goſpell, which ſure knowledge bringeth the peace and reſt of conſcience towardes God. The ſumme therefore is, that if ſaluation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the obſeruation of the law, the mynde of man coulde haue no certainty thereof: yea what promiſes ſoeuer were offered vs of God, they ſhould be voyde and of none effect. So miſerable &amp; wretched are we, if we be turned ouer vnto workes, whiles the cauſe and certainty of ſaluation is to be ſought for.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <hi>15 For the law &amp;c.</hi> This is a confirmation of the former ſentence, taken from the contrary effect of the lawe. For ſeeing the law begetteth nothing but vengeance, it cannot bring grace. To thoſe were good and perfect it would ſhew the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe:<note place="margin">The law by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing but vengeance.</note> but in as much as it commaundeth thoſe are ſinfull &amp; corrupt, what they ought to doe, and miniſtreth not ſtrength to performe the ſame, it proueth them guilty before the iudgement ſeate of God. For ſuch is the corruption of our nature, that the more we are taught what is iuſt and right, the more plainely is our iniquity diſcouered,<note place="margin">Wrath for iudgement.</note> and chiefly our diſobedience: and ſo the greater iudgement of God is procured. <hi>By wrath</hi> vnderſtand the iudgement of God, in whiche ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is often vſed. They whiche vnderſtande it, that the wrath of the ſinner is inflamed by the lawe, becauſe he hateth and curſeth the Lawgiuer, whom he ſeeth to be aduerſant to his luſtes: They ſay that wittily, but yet vnfitly in reſpect of the preſent place. For, that Paule woulde not any thing els but ſhewe, howe nothing except con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7612:67"/>
commeth vnto vs all by the lawe, both the common vſe of the woorde, and alſo the reaſon which hee addeth ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doth declare. <hi>Where there is no lawe.</hi> The ſecond proofe wherby he confirmeth that whiche hee ſaid. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would haue beene obſcure how the <hi>wrath of God</hi> ſhould be kindled againſt vs by the lawe, vnleſſe the reaſon were more apparant. And that is, becauſe we hauing taſted the knowlege of the iuſtice of God by the lawe,<note place="margin">The more know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge men haue the more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous is their tranſgreſſion.</note> offende ſo much the more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly againſt God, as there remaineth leſſe excuſe vnto vs. For they are worthie to ſuſteine more greeuous puniſhment, whiche deſpiſe the knowen will of God, then they ſinne of ignoraunce. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of the ſimple tranſgreſſion of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, from the which no man is exempted: but hee calleth that tranſgreſſion, when a mans minde, beyng taught what doth pleaſe or diſpleaſe God, doth wittingly and willingly burſt the boundes preſcribed vnto him by the worde of God. And that I may ſpeake in a worde, tranſgreſſion heere doeth not ſignifie a ſimple offence, but a purpoſed ſtubbornes in violating iuſtice. I take this <hi>particle <hi>ou</hi>

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reading ſoeuer you followe, the ſame ſenſe abydeth: namely, that hee who is not inſtructed by the written Law, if hee offende, is not guiltie of ſo greate tranſgreſſion, as hee who ſtubbornely infringeth and breaketh the Lawe of God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7612:68"/>
of the argument, ſo that you may gather the whole into this ſumme. If the inheritance of ſaluation come vnto vs by workes, then ſhall the faith thereof fall, the promiſe of it ſhall be of none effect: but both theſe muſt be ſure. Therfore it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto vs by faith, that the firmeneſſe thereof beeing founded vpon the only goodneſſe of God, it might haue a ſure effect. See howe the Apoſtle eſteeming faith by firme,<note place="margin">True faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; doubting</note> and ſtable certaintie, doth counct doubting, and wauering for incredulitie, whereby, both faith is aboliſhed, and the promiſe abrogated. And yet this is that doubting, which the Schoole men terme Moral coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and, (if it pleaſe God) they put it in ſteed of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it might come by grace.</hi> Here firſt the Apoſtle ſheweth, that nothing is ſet before faith, but meere grace: and this is as they commonly terme it,<note place="margin">The grace of god is the obiect of faith.</note> his obiect. For if it reſpected merits, wrongfully ſhould the Apoſtle inferre, that that is of free grace whatſoeuer faith obteineth for vs of God. I will repeate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in other wordes, if it bee of grace, whatſoeuer wee obtein by faith, then all reſpect of workes doth lye dead. But that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che followeth nexte, doth more clearely remooue all ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or doubtfulneſſe: namely, that the promiſe then ſtandeth firm, when it leaneth vpon grace. For by this worde Paule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that ſo long as men depende vppon workes they are in ſuſpence or doubt: becauſe they depriue themſelues of the fruite of the promiſes. Here alſo we may eaſily gather, that grace is not (as ſome imagine) taken for the gift of regeneration, but for free mercy or fauour: for as regeneration is neuer perfect, ſo ſhoulde it neuer ſuffice to appeace the conſciences, neither by it ſelfe ſhoulde it make the promiſe firme. <hi>Not to that onely which is of the law.</hi> Wheras this clauſe els where doth ſignifie thoſe,<note place="margin">Thoſe Iewes who being brought vp in the law, renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and cleaue vnto Chriſt, are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due abide vnder the curſe.</note> who being prepoſterouſly zealous of the lawe, tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the yoke thereof, and glorye in confidence of it: heere it ſignifieth ſimply the nation of the Iewes, to whome the lawe of the Lorde was deliuered. For whoſoeuer abide vnder the power of the lawe, Paule in another place teacheth, they are ſubiect to the curſe. And therefore it is certaine, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the participation of grace: he meaneth not then the ſeruants of the lawe, who being addicted to the righteouſneſſe of workes, renounce Chriſte: but the Iewes who being brought
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7612:68"/>
vp in the lawe, gaue their name to Chriſte. But that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may bee more cleare, reſolue it thus. <hi>Not to them onely which are of the law, but to all thoſe which follow the faith of Abraham, although they had no lawe before. Who is the father of vs all.</hi> The relatiue hath the force of a cauſall particle. For thereby hee goeth about to proue, the Gentiles to bee partakers of this grace, becauſe by the ſame Oracle wherein the inheritance was giuen to Abraham and his ſeede, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were receiued into his ſteede. For it is ſaid, he is ordeined to bee the father, not of one, but of many nations: wherein was prefigured the diſpenſation, of the grace to come, which then was conteined in Iſrael onely. For vnleſſe the promiſed bleſſinge were extended vnto them, they coulde not be reckoned amongſt the ſeede of Abraham. The pretertence of the verbe according to the common vſe of the Scripture, noteth the certaintie of the counſaile of God. For although nothing appeared then leſſe: yet becauſe God had ſo ordeined,<note place="margin">How Abraham is the father of many natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> he is truely ſaide to bee appointed the father of many nations. Let the teſtimonie of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes bee included in a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſentence may be ioyned, <hi>Who is the father of vs all before God &amp;c.</hi> For it was nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo to ſhewe what was the forme of that conſanguinitie or kinred: leaſt the Iewes ſhoulde glory to muche in their carnall generation. Hee ſaith therefore Abraham is our. father <hi>before God,</hi> which is as much as if hee ſhoulde call him a ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For hee hath that priuiledge not from his owne fleſh, but from the promiſe of God.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <hi>17 Whome hee beleeued, who quickeneth the dead.</hi> In this circumlocution the very ſubſtance of Abrahams faith is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: that from his example he might paſſe vnto the Gentiles.<note place="margin">The ſubſtance of Abrhams faith.</note> For Abraham was to come vnto that promiſe whiche hee had heard from the mouth of God, by a wonderfull way, ſeeing there appeared as yet no token thereof. Seede was promiſed to him, as vnto one that had beene luſtie and liuely: but hee was dead. Therefore it lay vpon him to haue his cogitation erected, vnto that power of God, whereby he quickeneth thoſe that are dead. Now there is no abſurditie if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles which otherwiſe are barren and deade, be incorporate into the ſocietie. For he which therefore denyeth them to be capable of grace, doeth iniurie vnto
<pb facs="tcp:7612:69"/>
Abraham, whoſe faith did leane vpon this cogitation, that it mattereth not though he be dead which is called of the Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life: who can eaſily by his worde through his power raiſe the dead.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, here we haue a type and example of our vniuerſal calling.<note place="margin">Whiles the Lo. calleth vs vnto life, there is no ſparkle of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in vs, we are as a dead &amp; dried tree.

For whatſoeuer we ſeeme to be, yet haue we not any ſparkle of goodneſſe, whereby we might bee made apte for the kingdome of God.

               <p>This is the condition of calling, that they which are dead in themſelues might be raiſed vp of the Lorde: they which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by his vertue may begin to bee ſomething. The word cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ought not to be reſtrained vnto preaching, but according to the vſuall maner of the ſcripture, it is taken for to raiſe vp: and the rather to ſet foorth the power of God, who by a becke only, can raiſe vp whom he will.</p>

And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no greater enemie vnto faith, then to tye our mindes to our eyes, that from their ſight wee might take the matter of hoping.</p>
               <p>It maye alſo bee read, <hi>aboue hope,</hi> and perhaps more fitly: as though hee ſaide that Abraham by his faith did farre exceede, or goe beyonde whatſoeuer hee could conceiue. For vnleſſe faith by celeſtiall winges flie vppe, that it mighte

Nowe he ſheweth more nearely what might haue hindered,<note place="margin">What thinges might haue hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the faith of Abraham.</note> yea, what might haue vtterly turned Abraham from receiuing the promiſe. Seede was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, when by nature neither he was fit for generation, nor Sara for conception. Whatſoeuer hee coulde ſee in him ſelfe or about himſelfe, it was againſt the effect of the promiſe. Therefor that he might giue place vnto the truth of God, as though hee had forgot himſelfe, hee withdraweth his mind from thoſe thinges were in his ſight. Yet you are not to vnderſtand it, as though hee had no reſpecte at all to his barraine or dead body: Seeing the Scripture teſtifieth he reaſomed thus with himſelf, ſhall a childe be borne to a man that is an hundreth yere olde? and ſhall Sara which is nienetie beare a childe? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that conſideretion being laide apart, he reſigned his whole ſenſe ouer to the Lorde: the Apoſtle ſaith he conſidered not. And ſurely it was an argument of greater conſtancie, to drawe his cogitation from that thing whiche did voluntarie offer it ſelf to his eyes, then if no ſuch thing had come into his minde. And that the body of Abraham for age was paſt fruite, before the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing of the Lorde, It may plainely be proued both heare, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo out of the ſeuenteene and eighteene chapters of Geneſis.<note place="margin">Gee. 17. &amp;. 18</note> So that the opinion of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is in no wiſe to bee admitted, who in a certaine place, thinketh that the cauſe was onely in Sara. Neither ought the abſurditie of the obiection mooue vs, which droue him vnto that reſolution. He thinketh it very ridiculous, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Abraham at an hundreth yeeres ſhoulde be called barraine, who ſometime after had many children. For thereby the Lord made his power more notable, that hee which before was like a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and drie poſte, when through the bleſſing of God he floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, he was not onely ſufficient for the procreation of Iſaac: But as one reſtored vnto a floriſhing age, he had ſtrength after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to beget others. But ſome will ſay, it is not beſides the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, that a man ſholde beget a childe at that age. That I may graunt it is not a wonder, yet it differeth little from a myracle. Conſider alſo with what labours, moleſtations, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinations, &amp; extremities that good man was exerciſed all his life: and then you muſt needes confeſſe hee was no more broken with age, then he was worne and waſted with labours.</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7612:70"/>Laſtly, his body is not ſimply, but by the way of compariſon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led barren or fruitleſſe. For it was not like, that he which in the flower, &amp; ſtrength of age was vnfit for procreation, ſhoulde then begin when he was voyd of ſtrength. Wheras he ſaith, he <hi>was not weake in faith,</hi> vnderſtand it thus, he did not ſhake or wauer as we are woont to doe in doubtfull things.

For the intellect is neuer ſo illuminated, but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne many reliques of ignorance: the mynd is neuer ſo ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but there abydeth muche doubting.

As you may ſee in the Iewes, whiles they aſke Chriſt how he could giue his fleſhe to be eaten.</p>
               <p>Therefore Abraham is not reprehended for that he laughed, and demaunded how a ſonne ſhoulde be borne to a man of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth,

               <p>Let vs alſo remember, howe all of vs are in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Abraham.

For there is no lette or hinderaunce ſo ſmall or light, whereby fleſhe and

blood imagineth not that the hand of GOD may be driuen from his worke. Here vppon it commeth that in the leaſt temptations whatſoeuer, the promiſes of GOD ſlide from vs. Out of controuerſie no man denyeth, GOD can doe all: yet as ſone as any thinge is obiected which maye hinder the courſe of Gods promiſes, wee throwe downe the power of God from his ſtate. Wherefore, to the end it mighte obteine his righte, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure amongſt vs, when we happen vpon ſome compariſon, we muſt needes determine thus: that the power of God is no leſſe ſufficent to ouercome all impedimentes, or hindrances, then the ſhine of the Sunne is of force to diſperſe the cloudes. We are wont to excuſe that wee derogate nothinge from the power of God, as often as we doubte of his promiſes: namely,<note place="margin">By compariſon is meant the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliyng or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all his impediments.</note> becauſe this imagination, to wit, (that God hath promiſed more in his worde then hee is able to performe, which were open peruerſitie &amp; blaſphemie againſt god) is not the cauſe of doubting, but that ſame defect which we feele in our ſelues. But we doe not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aduaunce the power of God, vnleſſe we thinke the ſame, to be greater then our weakeneſſe. Faith therefore ought not to conſider our owne imbecilitie, miſerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and defect: but wholy to intend vpon the only power of God. For if righteouſnes ſhould depend vpon our worthinſſe, it woulde neuer ſcale vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the power of God. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> examination of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie, of the which he ſpake lately: when wee meaſure the power of the Lorde by our own foote. Neither doth faith ſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine God to bee able to doe whatſoeuer he will, that in the mean while it leaueth him ſitting idlely: but rather doth place his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in continuall action. And ſpecially it applieth the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer vnto the effect of his woorde, that the hande of God might be alwayes readie to execute whatſoeuer hee hath vttered by his mouth. I maruaile why the relatiue maſculine did pleaſe Eraſmus: for although the ſenſe be not thereby altered, yet had I rather come neere vnto the Greeke wordes of Paule.

                  <hi>23 Nowe it was not written.</hi> Becauſe a proofe taken from an example (as wee haue admoniſhed aboue) is not alway firme, leaſt that ſhoulde come into queſtion, Paule affirmeth plainely that in the perſon of Abraham was ſhewed an example of that common righteouſneſſe, which indifferently apperteineth vnto all. In this place we are admoniſhed of making our profite of examples in the ſcriptures. The Heathen haue truely called an hiſtorie <hi>the miſtres of life:</hi> but as it commeth from them, no man can ſafely profite in it: the ſcripture only doeth by right challenge that preheminence. For firſt it preſcribeth generall rules, whereunto we may bring euery hiſtorie for tryall, that it may ſerue to our profite, Secondly, it clearely diſcerneth what deedes are to be followed, and what are to be eſchewed. And as for doctrine, wherein it is chiefly conuerſant, it hath that peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to it ſelfe: as namely, it ſheweth the prouidence of the Lord, his iuſtice and goodneſſe towards his, and his iudgementes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reprobate. That therefore, which is ſaid of Abraham, Paule denieth it to haue been written for his cauſe onely. For it is not a thing which perteineth to the ſpeciall calling of ſome one and certaine perſon, but the maner of obteining righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is deſcribed, which is one and perpetuall amongeſt all: and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7612:72"/>
this deſcription is made in him that is the father of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, vpon whom the eyes of all ought to intende. Wherefore if we will handle the ſacred hiſtories purely and godly,<note place="margin">How wee ought to be occupied in the ſcripture.</note> wee muſte remember they are ſo to bee handeled, that we may reape thence the fruite of ſounde doctrine. And partly they inſtruct vs to frame our liues, partly to confirme our faith, partly to ſtirre vp the feare of the Lord. For the framing of our liues, the imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy fathers ſhall helpe, if wee learne of them ſobrietie, chaſtitie, loue, patience, modeſtie, contempt of the worlde, and other vertues. For the confirmation of our faith, the helpe of God maketh, which was alway preſent to them, his protection and fatherly care which hee alway had ouer them, ſhall miniſter conſolation in aduerſitie: the iudgements and puniſhments of God executed vpon the wicked, ſhall helpe vs, if they put into vs a feare, which may repleniſhe our heartes with reuerence and pietie. And whereas he ſaith: <hi>not for him onely,</hi> thereby hee ſeemeth to inſinuate, that it was partly written for his ſake: whereby ſome vnderſtande, that to the praiſe of Abraham it is ſaide what he obteined by faith: becauſe the Lorde will haue his ſeruants committed to eternall remembrance:<note place="margin">Pro. 10.7.</note> as Salomon ſaith, <hi>Their name is bleſſed.</hi> But what if you take it more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note place="margin">The example of Abraham as all other examples are written for our inſtruction.</note> (as though it were ſome ſpeciall priueledge which mighte not be drawen into an example) but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it alſo apperteineth to our inſtruction, who muſt be iuſtified by the ſame maner? this ſhalbe the fitter ſenſe.</p>

it ſtandeth vs vpon not onely to haue our mindes directed vnto Chriſt, but alſo to haue it diſtinctly opened vnto vs, how he hath purchaſed ſaluation for vs. And albeit the Scripture when it ſpeaketh of our ſaluation, ſtandeth onelie vpon the death of Chriſte, yet here nowe the Apoſtle goeth further. For becauſe his purpoſe was, to deliuer the cauſe of ſaluation more clearely, hee reckoneth two braunches thereof. And firſt he ſaith, our ſinnes are done away by the death of Chriſte: Secondly, that righteouſneſſe is purchaſed by his reſurrection.<note place="margin">The fruite of Chriſts death &amp; reſurrection is perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</note> The meaning is, when wee holde the fruite of Chriſtes death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing is miſſing vnto vs, as concerning perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And there is no doubt, but whiles he diſtinguiſheth the death of Chriſte from his reſurrection, hee applieth his talke to our capacitie: for otherwiſe it is true, the obedience of Chriſte which hee ſhewed in his death, was the righteouſneſſe purchaſed for vs: as he alſo will ſhew in the Chapter following. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by riſing from the dead Chriſte declared, how much he had preuailed by his death,<note place="margin">By the death of Chriſt our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is begun &amp; by his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected.</note> this diſtinction ſerueth to teach vs, that by that ſacrifice, wherein ſinnes are done away, our ſaluation was begunne, and by his reſurrection it was perfected. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of righteouſneſſe, is that wee be reconciled to God: and the perfection is, that death beeing ouercome, life might raigne. Paule therefore ſignifieth howe ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes was accompliſhed on the croſſe. For that Chriſte might reſtore vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the fauour of the father, it was meete our giltineſſe were aboliſhed by him: which coulde not bee vnleſſe hee woulde ſuffer that puniſhment for vs, which we were not able to abide. For the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him,<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.5.</note> ſaith <hi>Eſay.</hi> and hee choſeth rather to ſay he was deliuered, then dead: becauſe the ſatiſfaction dependeth vpon the eternall pleaſure of God, who would be pacified this way. <hi>And is riſen againe for our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi> Becauſe it was not ſufficient for Chriſte to oppoſe himſelfe to the ire and iudgement of God, and to take vpon him the curſe due to our ſinnes, vnleſſe hee ſhoulde alſo goe foorth the conquerour thereof,<note place="margin">How iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is aſcribed vnto the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſte.</note> that beeing receiued into the celeſtiall glory, by his interceſſion hee might reconcile God vnto vs. The vertue or power of iuſtification is aſcribed vnto the reſurrection whereby death was ouercome: not that the ſacrifice of the croſſe,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7612:73"/>
whereby wee are reconciled to God, did further our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nothing: but becauſe in the new life the perfection of this grace doth more clearely appeare. And yet I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not conſent vnto thoſe, who referre this ſeconde member vnto newneſſe of life: For the Apoſtle as yet hath not begunne to ſpeake of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſecondly, it is ſure that both members appertaine to one ende. Wherefore if iuſtification ſignifie renouation, then to haue died for our ſinnes, were to bee vnderſtoode in this ſenſe, namely, that hee died to purchaſe for vs the grace of mortifiyng the fleſhe: which thing none graunteth. Therefore as hee was ſaide to die for our ſinnes, becauſe the price of ſinnes being paide by his death, hee hath deliuered vs from the calamitie of death: So nowe he is ſaide to bee riſen for our iuſtification, becauſe by his reſurrection hee hath perfectly reſtored life vnto vs. For firſt hee was ſmitten by the hand of God, that in the perſon of a ſinner he might ſuſteine the miſerie of ſinne: Secondly, he was exalted into the kingdome of life, that he might indue his with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and life.

Therefore peace towardes God is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the drunken ſecuritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh: becauſe this is the firſt thing of al, that euery one might awake himſelf to giue account of his life: and none can ſtande without feare before God, but he which truſteth to the free reconciliation: for as long as God is a Iudge, all men muſt needes be terrified and troubled, which is a ſtrong argument, that our aduerſaries doe nothing but babble vnder a ſhadowe, when they aſcribe righteouſnes to works. For this concluſion of Paule, dependeth vpon that principle, namely that the miſerable conſciences of men doe alway ſhake, vnleſſe they reſt in the grace of Chriſt.</p>

But this grace is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to vs by the Goſpel, becauſe it is the miniſterie of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, through whoſe benefit wee are after a ſorte brought into the kingdome of GOD. Excellently therefore hath Paul ſet before our eyes a ſure pledge of the fauour of God in Chriſte,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7612:74"/>
whereby hee might the better drawe vs from the confidence of woorkes. And alſo teaching by the name of acceſſe,<note place="margin">We preuent not the mercie of God by our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</note> that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſaluation is of Chriſt, hee excludeth thoſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, whereby fooliſhe men thinke they doe preuent the mercie of God: as though hee ſayd, Chriſt doeth not come vnto vs, and help vs for our merites. Straightwayes after he addeth, that it is through the tenour of the ſame grace, that ſaluation abideth firme and ſure vnto vs: whereby he ſignifieth, that perſeuerance ſtandeth not in our owne vertue or induſtrie, but in Chriſt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though alſo, when hee ſaith <hi>wee ſtande,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Perſeuerance is of Chriſt.</note> hee ſheweth howe deepe rootes the Goſpell ought to take in the heartes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that they beeing ſtrengthened by the veritie thereof, may ſtande firme againſt all the engines or deuiſes of Sathan and the fleſhe. And by this woorde <hi>ſtanding,</hi> he ſignifieth that faith is not a wauering perſwation, or that continueth for one day: but ſtedie, and deepely ſetled in the mindes of men, that it might perſeuere the whole life. Hee therefore that is driuen by ſome ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> motion to beleeue, hath not faith ſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may be reckoned amongſt the faithfull: but hee which conſtantly and (that I may ſay ſo) with a firme foote abideth in that place which is ordeined to him of the Lorde, that hee may alway cleaue to Chriſt. <hi>And wee glorie vnder the hope.</hi> Hence the hope of life to come,<note place="margin">Whence, ioye &amp; hope of life to come ariſeth.</note> both ariſeth, and dareth to reioyce, namely, that we leane vppon the grace of God as vpon a foundation. For the meaning of Paul is, notwithſtanding the faithfull are nowe ſtraungers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, yet by their faith they ſurmount the heauens, that they may quietly nouriſhe in their boſome, the inheritaunce to come. And ſo two peſtilent doctrines of the Sophiſters are vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen.

               <p>For whereſoeuer there is an aduauncing of health: there wanteth no matter of glorying.

For they ought to inure vs vnto patience: and except they doe ſo, the worke of God through our corruption is made voyde and of none effecte. For whence prooueth hee that aduerſities hinder not the glory of the godly, but becauſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7612:75"/>
in bearing them patiently, they feele the help of God, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and confirmeth their hope? therefore it is ſure they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite but ill which learne not patience.

This knowledge of the loue of God towardes vs is put into our heartes by the ſpirite of God. For the good thinges whiche God hath prepared for his worſhippers, are hidden both from the eares, and eyes, and mindes of men: it is the ſpirite onely whiche can reueile them. And this participle, <hi>ſhedde abroade.</hi>

This is veryly a godly ſaying, but it commeth not neere the minde of Paule. For loue here is not taken actiuely, but paſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

For here beginneth an argument from the greater to the leſſe, which hee proſecuteth afterwarde at large. Albeit hee hath not framed the courſe of his ſpeach ſo diſtinct: but the diſordered compoſition of the ſpeach ſhall trouble the ſence nothing. If Chriſt (quoth hee) take pitie vpon the vngodly, if he reconciled his enemies to his father, if hee did this by the vertue of his death: nowe muche more eaſely will hee ſaue them being iuſtified: being reſtored to fauour, hee will keepe them in the ſame: chiefly ſeeing the efficacie of his life is nowe added vnto his death. Some take the time of weakneſſe for that time, wherein Chriſte beganne firſte to bee manifeſted to the worlde: and they ſuppoſe thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:7612:77"/>
men, who were vnder the erudition of the lawe, to haue bene like vnto children. But I referre it vnto euerie one of vs: and ſaye it noteth the tyme,<note place="margin">What tyme is called the tyme of weaknes.</note> that goeth before euery mans reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to God. For as we are all borne the ſonnes of wrathe, ſo are we holden vnder that curſe, vntill we be made partakers of Chriſt. And he calleth thoſe infirme or weake which haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge in them but it is corrupted. For he termeth the ſame ſtraightwayes after vngodly. Neither is it any newe thing that this word infirmitie ſhould be ſo taken. So he calleth the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie parts of the bodie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.22, 2. Cor. 10.10.</note> feeble: And the preſence of the bodie which hath no maieſtie, weake. And this ſignification a litle after doeth often occurre. Therefore, when we were feeble, that is, neither worthie nor mete that God ſhould reſpect vs, at that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Chriſt died for the wicked: becauſe faith is the beginninge of pietie, from the which they were all eſtraunged, for whome he died, which alſo taketh place in the old Fathers, who had obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned righteouſnes before this death. For they had that benefite from his death that was to come.</p>

               <p n="8">
                  <hi>8 And God confirmeth.</hi> Seeing this verbe <hi>ſuniſt eſi</hi> is of a doubtfull ſignification, it is more fitte in this place to bee taken for to confirme.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hee confirmeth.</hi> That is, he declareth his ſure &amp; moſt conſtant loue towards vs, in that for the vngodly ſake he ſpared not Chriſt his ſonne. For herein his loue appeared, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not being prouoked by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7612:77"/>
loue, of his owne free will he firſt loued vs, as Iohn ſaith. They are here called ſinners) as in many other places) who are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether corrupted, and addicted to ſinne: as Iohn ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.16.</note> God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſinners. That is ſuch as are deſperately,<note place="margin">Iohn 9.31.</note> and wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wickednes. A woman that was a ſinner, that is, of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt life. And that appeareth better by the Antitheſis, whiche ſtraightwayes followeth, beyng <hi>iuſtified by his blood.</hi> For ſeeyng hee oppoſeth theſe two betweene themſelues,<note place="margin">Luke 7.37.</note> and faythe they are iuſtified who are deliuered from the guiltineſſe of ſinne: it is a conſequent, they are ſinners who for their euill wookes are condemned. The ſumme is, if Chriſte by his death hath purchaſed righteouſneſſe vnto ſinners,<note place="margin">Chriſt is no leſſe able nor willing to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d then he was to redeeme.</note> much more ſhall hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, beyng now iuſtified, from deſtruction. And in this laſt member hee applyeth the compariſon of the leſſe and greater vnto this doctrine. For it were not enough that ſaluation was once purchaſed for vs, except Chriſte did conſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſafe and firme vnto the ende. And that is it the Apoſtle goeth about nowe, namely, that it is not to be feared leaſt Chriſt ſhould breake of the courſe of his grace in the middle raſe. For ſince he hath reconciled vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, ſuch is our condition, that hee will ſhewe foorth his fauour more effectually towardes vs, and dayly increaſe the ſame.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>10</bibl> For if, when wee were enemies, wee were reconciled to God by the death of his ſonne: much more being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhall wee be ſaued by his life.</q>
               <p>This is an expoſition of the former ſentence with an amplification, taken frome the compariſon of life and death. Wee were enemies (quoth hee) when Chriſte tooke vpon him the mediation to reconcile the father. Nowe we are friendes through his reconciliation: if that coulde bee brought to paſſe by his death, his life ſhall be of greater power, and more effectuall. So then we haue notable teſtimonies, which may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſaluation in our heartes. His meaning is, wee were reconciled to GOD by the death of Chriſte, becauſe it was the ſacrifice of reconciliation, whereby GOD was
<pb facs="tcp:7612:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reconciled to the worlde, as I haue declared in the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But here the Apoſtle ſeemeth to be contrary vnto himſelfe. For if the death of Chriſt were the pledge of the loue of God towards vs:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> It followeth that euen then we were acceptable to him,<note place="margin">Anſweare.</note> but now he ſaith we were enimies: I aunſweare, becauſe God hateth ſinne, we alſo are odious vnto him, as we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but as in his ſecret counſayle he electeth vs into the body of Chriſt, he ceaſeth to hate vs. But the reſtoring into fauour is vnknowne vnto vs, vntill we perceiue it by faith. Therefore in reſpect of our ſelues, we are alway enimies, vntil the death of Chriſt come betweene to reconcile God. And this difference of a twofold reſpect is to be noted. For otherwiſe we know not the free mercy of God, then if we be perſwaded that he ſpared not his onely begotten ſonne, becauſe he loued vs at ſuche time as there was enmitie betweene him and vs: Againe wee doe not ſufficiently feele the benefite brought vnto vs by the death of Chriſte, except this be vnto vs the beginning of our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, that wee being perſwaded, the ſatiſfaction being perfourmed, hee is nowe fauourable to vs, who before was iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angrie with vs. So when acceptation into grace is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the death of Chriſte, the meaning is, that then the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is taken away, whereunto wee are otherwiſe ſubiect.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>11</bibl> And not this onely: but alſo wee reioyce in God through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: by whome we are nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</q>

This ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence muſte be annexed vnto the wordes wente before, where it was ſaid, that they which wanted the lawe did not impute ſinne vnto themſelues.

               <p>For albeit hee oftentimes maketh mention of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yet maketh hee mention thereof no where but there is a defecte, or at the leaſt ſome eclipſe, whiche verily are faultes in ſpeeche, yet ſuch as are not preiudiciall to the maieſtie of the celeſtiall wiſedome is deliuered vnto vs by the Apoſtle. But rather it is brought to paſſe by the ſinguler prouidence of God, that vnder a baſe ſtile, theſe high myſteries ſhould be deliuered vnto vs: that our fayth might not depende vppon the power of humane eloquence, but vppon the onely efficacie of the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>And hee doeth not heere as yet preciſely vnfoulde that maner of correction: but ſimply hee teacheth there is a greater meaſure of grace purchaſed by Chriſt, then of condemnation contracted by the firſt man. Whereas ſome thinke the Apoſtle diſputeth or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an argument here, I know not whither all will approue of it or no. In deed it might (&amp; that not vnaptly) be inferred, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall of Adam were of ſuch force to the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many, much more effectuall is the grace of God to the benefit of many: ſeeing it is graunted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt is of far greater power to ſaue, then Adam to deſtroy.

               <p>The firſt is, that through the ſinne of Adam we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by ſole imputation, as though the puniſhment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faulte were exacted vppon vs: but therefore ſuſteyne wee the puniſhment of his ſinne, becauſe wee are alſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his crime, Namely in as muche as our nature beeing corrupted in him, is holden guiltie of iniquitie before GOD. But by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſte, wee are reſtored in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorte vnto ſaluation. For it is not therefore imputed vnto vs as though it were within vs: but becauſe wee poſſeſſe Chriſt

Therefore to obtayne the miſerable inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of ſinne, it is inough to be a man for it abideth in fleſh and blood. But to obtaine the righteouſnes of Chriſt, thou muſt needs be a faithfull man: becauſe that by faith his felowſhip is obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to infantes by a ſpeciall maner: for they haue the priuiledge of adoption in the couenant, whereby they paſſe into the ſocietie of Chriſt. I ſpeake of the children of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnto whom the promiſe of grace is directed, for others are not exempted from the common eſtate.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>18</bibl> Therefore as by the offence of one condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>came</hi> vpon all men: ſo by the iuſtification of one, iuſtification of life <hi>is come</hi> vpon all men.</q>
               <p n="18">
                  <hi>18</hi> This is an imperfect ſpeech, which may be made perfect if the words condemnation and iuſtification be read in the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue caſe, as ſure they muſt bee reſolued if you will haue the ſence perfect. And it is the generall concluſion of that compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which went before. For now, hauing omitted the mention of the interpoſed correction, he knitteth vp that ſimilitude, as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one we are made ſinners: ſo the righteouſnes of Chriſt is effectual to iuſtifie vs: although he putteth not <hi>dikaioſunen,</hi> That is, the righteouſnes of Chriſt, but <hi>dikaioma,</hi> that is, the iuſtification of Chriſt: that he might admoniſh, how Chriſt is not iuſt priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himſelfe, but that righteouſnes wherewithall hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed doeth extende further,<note place="margin">How the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of chriſt is common to al</note> namely, that bee might inriche the faithfull with the gift beſtowed vpon him.

are partakers of it indeede. For albeit Chriſte ſuffered for the ſinnes of the whole worlde, and bee indifferently through the goodneſſe of God offered vnto all, yet all doe not receiue him. And thoſe two wordes which hee vſed of late may be repeated in this ſenſe, as by the iudgement of God it came to paſſe, that the ſinne of one ſhoulde redownd to the condemnation of many, ſo ſhal grace be effectual to the iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many. Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life (in my iudgement) is taken for abſolution, whiche reſtoreth life vnto vs, as though hee called it a quickening iuſtification. For thence commeth the hope of ſaluation, if God bee mercifull vnto vs: and of neceſſitie wee muſte be iuſte, that wee may bee acceptable to him. Therefore life commeth of iuſtification.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>19</bibl> For as by the diſobedience of one man, many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many bee made iuſte.</q>
               <p>This is no ſuperfluous ſpeeche, but a neceſſary declaration of the former ſentence. For it ſheweth that we are ſo guiltie by the offence of one man, that we are not innocent. Hee ſaid before we were damned: but leaſt any man ſhould attribute vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe innocencie, he woulde alſo adde, that euery one is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe he is a ſinner.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when hee ſaith wee are iuſtified by the obedience of Chriſte: heereby wee gather, Chriſte, in that hee ſatiſfied the father, to haue purchaſed righteouſneſſe for vs.<note place="margin">Righteouſnes is a qualitie in Chriſt, and is made ours by imputation.</note> Whereupon it followeth, the qualitie of righteouſneſſe is in Chriſte: but that is imputed vnto vs, whiche is proper to him. And alſo hee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth what kinde of righteouſneſſe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſte is, when hee calleth it obedience: where let vs note I pray you, what we muſt bring into the ſight of God, if we wil be iuſtified by workes, namely, obedience of the lawe, not ſuch as is perfecte in ſom one part or other, but which is euery way perfect. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſt man fall, all his former righteouſneſſe is not remembred. Here alſo wee are to learne, that they are peruerſly ledd in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, who of themſelues deuiſe, what they may thruſt vpon him. For then wee worſhip him beſt, when wee followe that which he hath commaunded vs, and giue obedience to his worde.

Let them goe now who boldly claime vnto themſelues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of works, which is not otherwiſe then when the law is fully and perfectly kept.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which he eſteemeth no better then dounge. For obedience is better then ſacrifices.</p>

                  <hi>20 Moreouer the law entred.</hi> This queſtion dependeth of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſaid before: namely, that ſin was before the law were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: for that being once heard, this followed ſtraightwaies, to what end then was the law needfull? Wherfore of neceſſitie this difficultie was to be vnfolden: but becauſe then it was not meet to make any longer digreſſion, hee differred it vnto this place. And now alſo by the way he doth diſpatch it,<note place="margin">The law was partly giuen that men might the better ſee their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> ſaying, the law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, that ſin might abound. He doth not here ſhew the whole of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice &amp; vſe of the law: but toucheth one onely parte, which ſerued for the preſent purpoſe. For he teacheth, that to the end the grace of God might haue place, it was expedient men ſhould better ſee their owne deſtruction. They were verily before the lawe caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: yet becauſe they did ſeeme vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſwim in their owne deſtruction, they are thruſt downe into the deepe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance might be the more excellent, whiles beyond all mans iudgement they eſcape thence. Neither was it abſurd that the law ſhould partly be giuen for this cauſe, that men alreadie once condemned, it might twiſe condemne: for there is nothing more iuſt, then that men by all meanes might be brought, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuicted might be drawen to feele their euils. <hi>That ſinne might abound.</hi> It is knowen howe ſome after <hi>Auguſtine</hi> are wont to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this place: namely, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence is ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more prouoked, whiles it is reſtrained by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barres of the law: becauſe it is naturall vnto man to ſtriue after that is forbidden. But I vnderſtand no other augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be noted here, then of knowledge and obſtinacie. For by the lawe, ſinne is laide open

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation prepared for him. So ſin occupieth the conſcience, which otherwiſe being caſt behinde them, men made no account of.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he which before did ſimply paſſe the bounds of iuſtice, now a law being giuen, is a deſpiſer of the authoritie of GOD, ſince the time that the will of God was knowen vnto him, which he according to his luſt hath ſhamefully conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned.<note place="margin">How ſinne is increaſed by the lawe.</note> Whereupon it followeth, that ſin is increaſed by the law, becauſe then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority &amp; maieſtie of the lawmaker is deſpiſed. <hi>Grace alſo hath ſuperabounded.</hi> After that ſin had holden men, being ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therewith, then grace did helpe.

               <p n="20">
                  <hi>20 That as ſin raigned in death:</hi> As ſin is called the ſting of death, becauſe death hath no power againſt man,<note place="margin">Death hath no autoritie at all ouer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but by ſin, therfore ſin executeth his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie by death.</note> but for the cauſe of ſin: ſo ſin executeth his power by death.

The <hi>antitheſis</hi> had been ſimple, if he had ſaid thus, that righteouſnes might raigne by Chriſt. But Paule not being content to haue oppoſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to contraries, addeth grace: to the end he might print more deepely in memory, that it is not of our merite, but wholy of the bountifulneſſe of God.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat ſhall wee ſay then?</hi> In this whole Chapter the Apoſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they doe wickedly rente Chriſte aſunder, who imagine free righteouſnes to bee giuen of him vnto vs, without newnes of life. Although he goeth further, obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that then it ſeemeth there is place giuen vnto grace, if men bee plunged in ſinne. For wee knowe there is nothing more readie, then that fleſhe ſhoulde euery way flatter it ſelfe, and that Satan ſhoulde deuiſe reproches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he might ſlaunder the docrine of grace, which thing to doe is no harde matter for him.<note place="margin">The dotrine of grace muſt not therefore be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed becauſe many take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes at it.</note> For ſeeing that is moſt ſtrange vnto mans reaſon, whatſoeuer is preached of Chriſte, it ought to bee no maruaile, if the fleſh, after it hath hard the iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, doe ſo often (as it were) daſh vpon diuers rockes. Howbeit wee muſt goe on, for Chriſt is not therefore to be ſuppreſſed, becauſe he is vnto many a ſtone of offence, and rocke of ſtumbling. For looke by what way he ſhalbe vnto the ruine of the wicked, the ſame way againe hee ſhal bee to the riſing of the godly. And yet notwithſtanding we are alway to occurre vnreaſonable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, leaſt the docrine of Chriſt ſhoulde ſeeme to drawe with it any abſurditie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Apoſtle now purſueth that obiection, whiche commonly is obiected againſt the doctrine of the grace of God: namely, if it be true, that the grace of God doth help vs ſo much the more bountifully, and largely, as we haue beene ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7612:84"/>
with a greater weight of ſinne, there is nothing more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for vs, then that wee being drowned in the depth of ſinne, ſhoulde oftentimes by newe offences prouoke the wrath of God:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> For ſo at length we ſhall feele greater plentie of grace, then the which, nothing is more to be wiſhed for. As for the maner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation we ſhall ſee it afterwarde.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2 God forbid.</hi> Some think that the Apoſtle doeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way of a <hi>ſharpe correction</hi> reprehende ſo vnreaſonable a madneſſe: but by other places it doth appeare howe familier an anſwere this is with him, yea, in much diſputation or many ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guments: as here alſo he wil ſhortly with great diligence refute the obiected obloquie: yet firſt by this particle of one deteſting he doth reiect it, that he might admoniſhe the readers, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vnlike, then that the grace of Chriſte, the repayrer of our righteouſneſſe, ſhoulde nouriſhe our vices.<note place="margin">The grace of Chriſt aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth ſinne, and therefore doth not nouriſh it.</note> 
                  <hi>Whiche are dead to ſinne.</hi> This is an argumen taken from the contrary, For it is certaine, that he which ſinneth, liueth to ſinne: but we are dead to ſinne by the grace of Chriſt: therefore is it falſe, that that ſhoulde nouriſhe ſinne, which doth aboliſh it. For thus the caſe ſtandeth, the faythfull are neuer reconciled vnto God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gift of ſanctification: yea to this ende are wee iuſtified, that after warde we might worſhip God in holineſſe of life. For Chriſte doth not otherwiſe waſhe vs with his blood, and by his ſatiſfaction reconcile God vnto vs, then whiles hee maketh vs partakers of his ſpirite, which reneweth vs into an holy lyfe. It were therefore too prepoſterous an inuerſion of the worke of God, if by occaſion of that grace which is offered vs in Chriſte, ſinne ſhoulde gather any ſtrength. For the medicine is not the nouriſhour of that it extinguiſheth. Finally we muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that, I touched of late: namely, that Paule doth not here ſay what God doth finde vs to bee whiles he calleth vs into the ſocietie of his ſonne, but what wee ſhoulde bee, after he hath had mercy vpon vs, and hath adopted vs freely. For by a verbe of the future te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, he ſheweth what manner of chaunge ſhould followe righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>3.</bibl> Know ye not, that all wee which haue beene baptiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſus Chriſt, haue beene baptiſed into his death.</q>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:85"/>
                  <bibl>4</bibl> Wee are buried then with hym by baptiſme into his death, that like as Chirſte was raiſed vppe from the dead by the glory of the father, ſo wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.</q>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3 Know ye not.</hi> He proueth the former ſentence: namely, that Chriſt killeth ſin in his, by the effect of baptiſme, wherby we are incorporated into his faith. For it is out of queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee put on Chriſte in baptiſme:<note place="margin">Then do we tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly grow vp into the body of chriſt when his deathe bringeth foorthe fruit in vs.</note> and with this condition are we baptiſed, that we ſhoulde be one with him. Now Paule taketh another principle: namely, that we do then indeede grow vp into the body of Chriſt, when his death bringeth foorth his fruite in vs. Yea he teacheth that this participation of death, is principally to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in baptiſme. For not onely purgation, but alſo mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the dying of the old man is propoſed there: whereby it is manifeſt, after we are receiued into the grace of Chriſt, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie of his death appeareth ſtraight wayes. Finally, what this ſocietie with the death of Chriſte auaileth, it followeth ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4 Being buried then with him.</hi> Now he beginneth to ſhew, although he doe not plainely declare, whereunto it apperteineth that we are baptized into the death of Chriſt: namely, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead vnto our ſelues, might become new men. For from the participation of his death, he paſſeth conueniently vnto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of life: becauſe theſe two hang together by an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable connexion:<note place="margin">Mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; newnes of life go together.</note> namely, the old man to bee aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, that his reſurrection might reſtore righteouſnes, and make vs new creatures. And ſurely ſeeing Chriſt is giuen vs vnto life, to what end ſhold we die with him, except we might riſe againe vnto a better life? And therfore to no other ende hath he flaine that is mortal in vs, but that he might truly quicken vs. Furthermore, let vs note that the Apoſtle doth not ſimply heere exhort vs to imitate Chriſt, as if he ſaid the death of Chriſt is in ſteed of an example, which all Chriſtians ought to follow. For he ſurely goeth higher, deliuering doctrine, out of the which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he draweth exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is eaſie. And this is the doctrin, that the death of Chriſte is effectuall to extinguiſh and baniſh the prauitie of the fleſh: and his reſurrection to raiſe vp the newnes
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7612:85"/>
of a better nature: and that by baptiſme we are receiued into the participation of this grace. This foundation being laide, a man may very aptly exhort Chriſtians, that they ſtriue to aunſwere their calling. Moreouer, it forceth not that this vertue doeth not appeare in all thoſe are baptized. For Paule after his manner, becauſe he ſpeaketh vnto the faythful, conioyneth the ſubſtance &amp; effect w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the external ſigne. For we know that by their faith is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed &amp; ratified whatſoeuer the Lord offereth by the viſible pledge. To be briefe he teacheth what is the veritie of baptiſme rightly receiued. So to the Galathians he teſtifieth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal. 3.27.</hi> When the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall pledges and when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be but bare ſignes.</note> that all they whoſoeuer are baptiſed in Chriſt haue put on Chriſte. For ſo a man muſt ſay ſo long as the inſtitution of the Lord, and the faith of the godly agree together, For we neuer haue bare and idle ſignes, but when our vnthankfulnes and wickednes hindereth the working of Gods bountifulnes. By the <hi>glory of the father:</hi> That is, through his notable power, whereby hee hath declared himſelfe truely glorious, and hath (as it were) manifeſted the greatnes of his glory. So oftentimes in ſcripture is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God which hath ſhewed it ſelfe in the reſurrection of Chriſt, ſet foorth by ſome excellent title: and not without cauſe, for it is grealy materiall, that by ſuch expreſſe mention of the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable power of God, not onely the faith of the laſt reſurrection, which far exceedeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> capacity of fleſh, but alſo other fruits which we receiue by the reſurrection of Chriſt, ſhold be highly extolled with vs.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>5</bibl> For if we be graffed into the ſimilitude of his death, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo alſo ſhall we be partakers of his reſurrection.</q>
               <q>
                  <bibl>6</bibl> Knowing this, that our olde man is crucified together with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that wee ſhould not ſerue ſinne any more.</q>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5 For if wee be graffed.</hi> By plainer wordes hee proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> argument, which he hath put downe before. For, the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude he bringeth in, taketh away al ambiguitie becauſe grafting doth not onely note the conformitie of example, but a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, whereby wee growe vppe together with him: ſo that hee quickening vs with his ſpirite; powreth his vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Therefore as a graft hath the condition of life and deathe
<pb facs="tcp:7612:86"/>
common together with the tree in the which it is grafted: ſo it is reaſon wee ſhoulde no leſſe bee partakers of the life then of the death of Chriſte. For if wee bee grafted into the ſimilitude of the death of Chriſte, and that is not without his reſurrection: then no more ſhal our death be without a reſurrection. But the wordes may haue a two folde expoſition, either that wee are grafted in Chriſt into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimilitude of his death: or ſimply we are grafted into his ſimilitude. The firſt acception would require the greek Datiue <hi>homoiomati,</hi> that is, to the ſimilitud, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the ſhewing of the maner. And I denie not but that hath a fuller ſenſe, yet becauſe the other agreeth better to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the worde, I haue thought good to preferre it. Albeit it is but a ſmall matter ſeeing both come to one ſenſe.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> thinketh Paule ſaid, the ſimilitude of death, for death: as in another place,<note place="margin">How wee are grafted into the ſimilitude of the death of Chriſt.</note> beeing made in the ſimilitude of men.

                  <hi>9 Death hath no more power ouer him.</hi> Hee ſeemeth to inſinuate, that death did once conquere or rule ouer Chriſte.

Albeit in ſpeaking more ſimplye, the power of death is referred vnto the voluntary condition of death, to whom reſurrection hath ſet an ende. The meaning is, Chriſt who nowe quickeneth the faithfull with his ſpirite, or inſpireth life into them by his ſecrete power from heauen, was exempted from the power of death, when he roſe agayne, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer all his from the ſame.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, in the phraſe of ſpeech is to bee noted what is proper vnto Chriſt.

And he ſaith that he dyed once, not onely becauſe eternall redemption beeyng purchaſed by his only one ſacrifice, &amp; purgation of ſinne being made by his blood, he hath ſanctified the faithfull for euer: but alſo that we might be aunſwearable by a mutuall reſemblance or ſimilitude.

And whereas he ſaith we muſt die to ſinne after his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is not ſo, that it may be called the ſame death. For we dye to ſinne, when ſinne dieth in vs, but it is otherwiſe in Chriſte who by dying, did put ſinne to flight.

For whereas he ſaide that Chriſt died once for ſinne, and liueth for euer vnto God, applying both vnto vs, he nowe admoniſheth howe wee may dye in liuing: namely when we renounce ſinne. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he omitteth not that parte, namely, when wee haue once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the grace of Chriſt by faith: although the mortification of the fleſh be but begun in vs, yet in this ſame is the life of ſinne extinguiſhed, that in ſteed therof ſpiritual newneſſe, which is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, might dure for euer.

the meaning therefore of the words is, eſteeme, the caſe is thus with you, as Chriſt died once, that he might ſlea ſinn, ſo you muſt die once that ye may ceaſe to ſinne hereafter: yea you muſt daily proceed in that mortification which is begun in you, vntil ſin be vtterly extinguiſhed.

The Apoſtle woulde neuer haue ſubiected ſuche a queſtion, excepte bee had meant, that we are freed from the rigour of the lawe, that God might no more deale with vs according to extreeme iuſtice: wherefore, there is no doubt but his meaning is to ſhewe heere ſome deliueraunce from the bondage of the lawe of the Lorde. But all contention layde aparte, I will briefly declare what I thinke. And firſt heere ſeemeth vnto mee to bee a conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherewith the faithfull are confirmed, that they faynte

not in the ſtudie of holines, through the feeling of their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Hee did exhort them that they ſhoulde apply all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto the obedience of righteouſneſſe. But ſo long as they carrie about the relikes of the fleſh, they muſte needes halte ſomewhat. Therefore leaſt they, being ouercome with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their infirmitie, ſhoulde diſpayre, he preuenteth this in time, comforting them in this, that their workes are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined according to the ſeuere rule of the law, but their impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being remitted, God doth fauourably &amp; mercifully accept of them. The yoke of the law cannot be borne, but it breaketh or cruſheth thoſe that beare it: it remayneth therefore that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flee vnto Chriſt, and deſire him to be their deliuerer. And ſo he offereth himſelf. For to this end tooke he vpon him the ſeruitude of the law, wherunto otherwiſe he was not a debter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might deliuer thoſe were vnder the lawe, as the Apoſtle ſaith vnto the Galathians.<note place="margin">

I take the particle aduerſatiue to bee put for a cauſall, whiche hapneth often: as though it were ſaid, becauſe we are vnder grace, therefore we are not vnder the law. Now the ſence ſhalbe plaine.

For howſoeuer we be vexed with the ſting of ſinne, yet it cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due vs, becauſe we get the vpper hande through the ſpirite of God: Moreouer being vnder grace we are free from the ſeuere exaction of the law. Here furthermore the Apoſtle is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to take it for a thing graunted, that all they who are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the grace of God, being bound vnto the yoke of the law, are holden vnder condemnation. And ſo on the contrary a man may argue, that ſo long as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are vnder the law, they are ſubiect to the power of ſinne.</p>

And this verily is the proper ſolution, that nothing els is taken away but the curſe of the lawe, whereunto all menne that are out of grace be ſubiect. But Paule albeeit hee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not expreſſely ſhewe that, yet indirectlye hee declareth it.</p>

If we ſinn, we deliuer our ſelues into the ſeruitude of ſinne: but on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, the faithfull are redeemed from the tyranny of ſinne, that they might ſerue Chriſt: therefore it is impoſſible they ſhould abyde bound vnto ſinne. But it ſhalbe profitable more neerely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe the order of this argument as it is digeſted of Paule. <hi>To whom you obey.</hi> This relatiue hath the force of a Particle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, as it doth often come to paſſe. Like as if one ſayd, there is no kynd of wickednes, a paricide wil not doe, who doubted not to commit the greateſt miſchiefe of al, &amp; ſuch a cruelty as in it ſelfe is almoſt abhorred of the very beaſtes. And the reaſon of Paule is taken partly from the effects, partly from the nature of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatiues. For firſt, if they obey, he gathereth they are ſeruants: becauſe their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teſtifieth that he hath power to command, who bringeth them ſo into his obſequie. This reaſon is taken from the effect of ſeruitude: out of the which aryſeth that other, if yee be ſeruauntes: Then agayne is the power of dominating

And therefore obedience, yea though y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name of God be not expreſſed, neuertheleſſe is referred vnto God, for it cannot be manifold.</p>

               <p>Hereuppon we may gather, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are not therefore freed from the ſeruitude of the law, that we ſhould ſinne: becauſe the lawe doeth not looſe his dominion or power, before the grace of God haue taken vs to it ſelfe, that it might reſtore righteouſnes in vs: and therfore it is impoſſible we ſhould be vnder ſinne, when the grace of God raigneth in vs. For we ſhewed before, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this woorde is conteyned the ſpirite of regeneration, <hi>you haue obeyed from the hearte.</hi> Here alſo Paule compareth by the way of contrarietie, the ſecrete vertue of the ſpirite,

with the externall letter, as though he ſaide, Chriſt inwardly frameth our heartes better, then if the lawe ſhoulde force them by threatning, and terrifiyng.

And the interrogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verily hath more ſtrength to ſet foorth the certaintie of the matter is ſpoken of. For it ſheweth that that is not ſtrange or vnknowen to any of them: but is indifferently graunted among all. <hi>For I ſpeake to them haue knowledge.</hi> This <hi>parentheſis,</hi> is to bee referred thither, whither the propoſition is referred, as if he ſhould ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew they were not ſo vnſkilfull of the law, as they could doubte of that. And albeit both might be vnderſtood, of all lawes together, yet is it better to vnderſtand it, of the lawe of God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is now in queſtion. Whereas ſome thinke the knowledge of the law, is attributed vnto the Romanes, becauſe the beſt part of the worlde, was vnder their Empire, &amp; gouernement, that is very childiſh. For partly he ſpeaketh vnto Iewes, or other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, partly vnto vulgare &amp; obſcure men. Yea, he chiefly reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Iewes, with whom he had to do concerning the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the law. And leaſt they ſhould thinke they were dealte withal very captiouſly, he ſheweth that he taketh a principle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; knowen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, wherof they could not be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who were brought vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their infancie in the doctrine of the law.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>For the woman which is in ſubiection to the man.</hi> He bringeth a ſimilitude, whereby hee proueth that we are ſo freed from the lawe, that it hath properly &amp; by right no power ouer vs any more. And albeit he coulde haue proued it by other reaſons: yet becauſe the example of matrimonie ſerued very well to ſet out the matter, in ſteed of a confirmation he hath inſerted a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litude taken from thence. Howbeit leaſt it ſhoulde trouble any man, that the members compared one with another do not agree at all: we are to be admoniſhed, that the minde of the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:7612:95"/>
was purpoſely by a little inuerſion to auoide the ſpite of a more rigorous or ſeuere worde. Hee ſhould haue ſayde, that he might haue framed his ſimilitude in order, the woman after the death of her huſbande is looſed from the bonde of matrimonie: the lawe which is in ſteede of an huſband to vs, is dead vnto vs. Therefore wee are free from the power thereof. But leaſt he ſhoulde offend the Iewes with the aſperitie of the word, if hee had ſaid that the lawe was dead, hee vſed a digreſſion, or deflection, ſaying, we are dead to the law. He ſeemeth vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to argue from the leſſer to the greater: yet becauſe I feare, leaſt that bee more wreſted, I rather allowe the former interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is more ſimple. The whole argument therefore is to be directed into this order. The woman is bound vnto her huſband by the lawe, ſo long as hee liueth, ſo that ſhee cannot take another: but after the death of her huſband ſhee is looſed from the bonde of that lawe, ſo that ſhe may marry whom ſhee will.</p>
               <p>Then followeth the application,</p>
               <p>The lawe was as it were our huſbande, vnder whoſe yooke we were holden, till it was dead vnto vs.</p>
               <p>After the death of the lawe, Chriſte took vs, that is, ioyned vs being freed from the law, vnto himſelfe. Therefore wee beeing ioyned vnto Chriſt riſen from the dead, ought to cleaue vnto him only: and as the life of Chriſt after his reſurrection is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo after this there ſhall be no diuorcement.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the word <hi>law</hi> is not alway here put in one and the ſame ſence:<note place="margin">The word lawe diuerſly taken.</note> but ſomtimes it ſignifieth the mutual right of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, ſometimes the authoritie of the huſband, to whom the wife is ſubiect, ſometimes the doctrine of Moſes. And we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Paule doth here touch that part only, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto the miniſterie of Moſes. For as concerning the tenne commandements wherein God hath deliuered what is right, &amp; hath ordered our life, wee are not to dreame of any abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lawe: becauſe the will of God ought to ſtand for euer. Therefore we are diligently to remember, that this deliuerance, is not from that righteouſnes is taught in the law: but from the ſeuere exaction of the law, and that curſe proceedeth thence. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:7612:95"/>
the rule of life, which the law preſcribeth is not abrogated: but that qualitie which is oppoſed to the liberty purchaſed by Chriſt, namely, whiles it requireth abſolute perfection: becauſe we per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fourme it not, it holdeth vs bounde vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gilt of eternal death. But becauſe his meaning was not, heere to decide what the right of matrimonie is: he was not greatly carefull to recko<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp the cauſes, which make a woman free from her huſband. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly therefore ſhould ſure doctrine in that reſpect be ſought for here.</p>

                  <hi>4 By the body of Chriſt.</hi> Firſt of all, Chriſt hauing erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the banner of his croſſe, did triumph ouer ſin: which could not be, vnleſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand writing were canceled, wherin we were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. That hand writing is the law, which, whiles it ſtandeth in force, maketh vs debters vnto ſin, &amp; therefore is called the ſtrength of ſin. From the power therfore of this hand writing we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the body of Chriſt, whiles it is faſtened to his croſſe.<note place="margin">How the law is the ſtrength of ſinne.</note> But the Apoſtle goeth further, namely, ſaying, that the bond of the law was looſed.

In the meane while he mitigateth the auſteritie of the ſentence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, that Chriſt deliuered vs from the yoke of the law, that he might graft vs into his own body.

Therefore it is no maruel if he deliuer thoſe from the yooke of the law, whom he coupleth vnto himſelf by a ſacred connexion, that they might be one body with him. <hi>His, who was raiſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead,</hi> We haue alredy ſaid, that Chriſt is put in the place of the law, leaſt any libertie ſhold be imagined w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out him, or leaſt any ſhould dare to make a diuorcement from the law,<note place="margin">The life purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt, is eternall.</note> not being yet dead to himſelf.

For ſo long as the litterall doctrine of the lawe ruleth and beareth ſwaye, the laſciuiouſneſſe of the fleſhe is not brideled, but rather it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Whereby it followeth that the kingdome of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not eſtabliſhed, till Chriſte haue freed vs from the lawe. And withall Paule admoniſheth what workes doe become vs beeyng looſed from the lawe. So long therefore as a man is holden vnder the yoke of the lawe, by ſinning continually, he can bring nothing vnto himſelfe but death. If the ſeruice of the lawe begetteth ſinne onely, then deliuerance which is contrary muſt tende vnto righteouſneſſe: if that lead vnto death, then this vnto life. But let vs conſider the very wordes of Paul. Whiles he goeth about to deſcribe that time, wherein wee were vnder the dominion of the lawe, hee ſaith we were in the fleſhe. Whereby we vnderſtand, that all they which are vnder the law,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7612:96"/>
reape nothing els thereby, then that without fruite and efficacie their eares are beaten with the externall breath thereof: ſeeing they are inwardly deſtitute of the ſpirite of God. Therefore they muſt needes abide altogether corrupt, &amp; peruerſe, vntill a better remedie come to heale their diſeaſe. And note the vſuall phraſe of the Scripture, to bee in the fleſh, for,<note place="margin">What it is to be in the fleſh.</note> to be indued onely with the gifts of nature, without that ſpeciall grace, wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth his elect. Furthermore, if this whole ſtate of life be corrupt it is apparant that naturally there is no part of our ſoule ſound: neither is there any other power of free wil, but that it may ſend foorth euyll affections as dartes into euery part. <hi>Affections of ſinnes which are by the lawe.</hi> That is, the lawe did ſtir vp euill affections in vs, which did declare their efficacie in all our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For there is no parte, which did not ſerue the euill affections. This is the worke of the lawe: namely, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our heartes the more, that they ſhoulde burſt foorth into ſuch luſtes, if that inwarde maſter of the ſpirite bee not preſent. But obſerue here, that the lawe is matched with the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man: whoſe peruerſitie and luſt, the more it is reſtrained by the barres of the lawe, the more furiouſly it burſteth foorth. He addeth againe, ſo long as the affections of the fleſhe were ruled vnder the law, they brought foorth fruite vnto death, that they might ſhew, how the lawe by it ſelfe killeth, whereby it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that they are fooliſh, who ſo greatly couet after that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, bringeth death.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6 But now wee are freed from the lawe.</hi> Hee purſueth his argument from contraries, if the bande of the lawe did ſo little preuaile to bridle the fleſhe, that it was rather an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne: then of neceſſitie muſt we be looſed, that we may ceaſe to ſinne. If then wee bee freed from the bondage of the lawe, that we might ſerue God: they doe wickedly, whiche take from hence libertie of ſinning. And they ſpeake wickedly, which ſay by this meanes the raines are looſed to concupiſcence. Note therefore, wee are then looſed from the lawe, when God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due vs, being freed from the ſeuere exaction, and curſe thereof, with his ſpirite, that wee might walke in his wayes. <hi>Beeing dead to it.</hi> This parte conteyneth a reaſon, or rather ſheweth the maner whereby we are deliuered: namely, whiles the law is

ſo farre foorth abrogated from vs, that we be not oppreſſed with the burden thereof: or leaſt that the ſeuere rigour thereof ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme vs in the Curſe. <hi>In the newneſſe of the ſpirite.</hi> Hee oppoſeth the ſpirite againſt the letter, becauſe, before that our will by the holy Ghoſte, be formed vnto the will of God, we haue nothing in the lawe but the outward letter:<note place="margin">Why newneſſe is aſcribed vnto the ſpirite.</note> which in deede bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleth our externall actions, but it reſtraineth not the furie of our concupiſcence at all.

But, ſeeing that is very abſurd, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did very well to take in hand to refute it. When hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth therfore, whether the law be ſin, his meaning is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it beget ſin ſo, that the fault thereof ought to bee imputed to the law.<note place="margin">Sinne remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in vs &amp; not in the lawe.</note> 
                  <hi>But I knew not ſin.</hi> Then doth ſinne abide in vs, and not in the law: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of ſin is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence of our fleſh, &amp; we come into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge therof by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of God, which is declared vnto vs in the law. But you are not to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, as though there were no difference at al betweene righte &amp; wrong without the law. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> either we are too blinde in ſeeing our corruption, or els whiles wee flatter our ſelues, wee are altogether ſecure: as alſo it followeth. <hi>For I had not knowen concupiſcence.</hi> This is therefore a declaration of the former ſentence: wherein he ſheweth that that ignoraunce of ſinne whereof hee ſpake, did ſtande in this, that men marked not their concupiſcence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:7612:97"/>And purpoſely he perſiſteth in one kynde, wherein chiefly Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie raygneth, whereunto retchleſſe pampering, and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is alway annexed. For men are neuer ſo depriued of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but externall woorkes keepe with them their difference. Yea they are forced alſo to condemne wicked counſels, and ſuch like deuiſes: which they cannot doe, but they muſt needes giue vnto a right will, that prayſe is due vnto it. But the faulte of concupiſcence is more hidden, and more deepely layde vppe: whereby it commeth to paſſe that it neuer commeth into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo long as men iudge according to their ſence. For he doth not boaſt himſelfe to haue beene voyde of it, but hee did ſo flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelfe, that hee made no account of that ſinne lurking in his heart. For ſeeyng he was deceiued for a tyme, when hee thought, that righteouſneſſe coulde not be hindered by concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence: then at length he perceyued he was a ſinner, when he ſaw concupiſcence (of the which no man is voyde) to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Lawe. (<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth that Paule vnder this worde conteyneth the whole lawe: whiche, ſo that we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it well, is true. For when Moſes ſheweth of what things we are to take heede, leaſt wee offend or hurt our neighbour, he addeth thou ſhalt not luſt, which is to bee referred vnto all thoſe preceptes went before. There is doubt but in the former commaundementes he had condemned whatſoeuer wicked affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions our hearts conceiue:<note place="margin">Concupiſcence without conſent is ſinne.</note> but there is great difference between a ſet will, and affections, whereby we are tickled. Therefore by this laſt precept, God requireth ſuch integrity of vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no corrupt luſt ſhould moue vs vnto euil, howſoeuer it be that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent not vnto it. And for this cauſe it was, I ſaide, Paule did mount high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the common capacity of man is able to reache. For po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike lawes cry that they puniſhe the counſelles and not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentes: and the Philoſophers more ſubtilly place both vices and vertues in the mynde: but God by this precept pearceth vnto the concupiſcence, which is more ſecrete then the will. And therefore men did not count it for ſinne. Neyther was it onelye pardoned of the Philoſophers, but at this day the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes contend mightely, that it is not ſinne in the regenerate. But Paule ſaith he found out his guiltineſſe, by this lurking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. whereupon it followeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are not excuſable, who ſo are

For it is not to be vnderſtood that he was at any time law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: but this word <hi>I liued</hi> is very ſignificant: becauſe the abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lawe made that he liued, that is, being puffed vp with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of his owne righteouſnes, he chalenged life vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when neuertheleſſe he was dead. That the ſentence may be more cleare, reſolue it thus, when ſomtime I was without law, I liued. And I ſaid, that this word was ſignificant, becauſe in fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe righteous, hee claymed vnto himſelfe life alſo: This then is the meaning, when I ſinned without knowledge of the lawe, ſinne was ſo drowned, that I did not obſerue it, and that it ſeemed almoſt to be dead. On the other ſide, I, becauſe I did not ſee that I was a ſinner, did pleaſe my ſelfe in my ſelfe, thinking that I had life at home with my ſelfe. For the death of ſinne, is the life of man: againe the life of ſinne is the death of man. But the queſtion is, what time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. how paul being brought vp of a childe in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the law is ſaide to haue liued ſometime without law.</note> wherein by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the lawe, or (as hee ſayth) by the abſence of the lawe, hee did confidently claime life vnto him ſelfe. For ſure it is hee was brought vp of a childe in the doctrine of the lawe: But that was a litterall Diuinitie, which doth not humble his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For as he ſaith in another place, the vaile was interpoſed, that the Iewes coulde not ſee the light of life in the lawe: So he alſo, ſo long as he beyng voyd of the ſpirite of Chriſte, had his eyes couered, did pleaſe himſelf in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> externall ſhew of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Hee therefore counteth the lawe abſent, which though it were preſent before his eyes, yet did not ſmite him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte ſence of the iudgement of the Lorde. Thus are the eyes of hypocrites couered with a vayle, that they ſee not howe much this precept requireth, wherein wee are forbidden of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence. <hi>But when the commaundement came.</hi> So nowe on the contrary hee counteth the lawe then to come, when it began truely to be vnderſtoode. The lawe therefore did (as a man woulde ſay) rayſe ſinne from the dead, becauſe it diſcouered vnto Paule, with howe muche corruption the inwarde partes of his heart abounded, and alſo did flea him. And let vs alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he ſpeaketh of a ſecure confidence, wherein hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites reſt, whiles they flatter themſelues, becauſe they wincke at their ſinnes.</p>

Thus we are to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the nature of the lawe, and our corruption. Whereby it followeth that wheras the law doth wound vs vnto death that is accidentical: as if an incurable diſeaſe ſhould be ſtirred vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more by an wholeſome medicine. Indeed I confeſſe it is an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accident, and therefore the lawe in another place in reſpect of the Goſpell, is called the miniſter of death: but yet this abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firme,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>11 hath lead mee out of the way.</hi> Verily true it is, although the will of God bee hidden from vs, and no doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine doth ſhine vnto vs, the whole life of men is wandering and full of errours: yea vntill the lawe doeth ſhewe vnto vs the way of a right life, wee can doe nothing but wander. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then wee beginne to feele our errour, when the Lorde doeth reproue vs a loude, Worthily ſaith Paule, that when ſin is diſcouered, then wee are ledde foorth of the way. So then the woorde <hi>Ex apatan:</hi> that is, to leade out of the way is not to bee vnderſtood of the thing it ſelfe, but of knowledge: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">How we are ſaid by occaſion of the law to be led forth of the way.</note> for that by the lawe it is apparnt howe much wee haue decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the right courſe: therefore of neceſſitie it was to bee tranſlated, <hi>hath ledde out of the way,</hi> becauſe hereby ſinners, (who went on ſecurely before) began to haue a loathing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking of them ſelues, whiles after the filthineſſe of ſinne was reueiled by the lawe, they vnderſtoode howe they made haſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. Finally hee inferreth agayne the name of occaſion, that wee might knowe howe the lawe by it ſelfe is not deadly, but that commeth otherwiſe, and is (as a man woulde ſay) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine or ſuch as commeth by ſome other meanes.</p>

to whom I doe ſo conſent, that I iudge there is included a great <hi>Emphaſis</hi> or force. To ſay, the lawe it ſelfe, and what ſo euer is commaunded in the lawe, that is all holy, and therefore is greatly to be reuerenced: it is iuſte, and therefore not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with any vnrighteouſnes: it is good, and therefore pure and cleane from all corruption.

                  <hi>13 Was that then which is good.</hi> Hitherto hee hath ſo cleared the lawe from all calumniations: that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it remained doubtfull, whither it were the cauſe of death or no. Yea here are mens mindes wonderfully plonged, how it may be, that we ſhold reape nothing but death, of ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a benefit of god. Now therfore he anſwereth that obiection, denying that death is of the lawe, although through occaſion thereof, it is brought vpon vs by ſinne. And albeit this anſwere ſeemeth to be contrary vnto that which hee ſayde before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the commaundement which was ordeined vnto life, was founde death vnto him: yet in deede there is no contrarietie. For before, he meant, that by our wickedneſſe it commeth to paſſe, that wee abuſe the lawe to our deſtruction, otherwiſe then the nature of it doeth beare:<note place="margin">The law is not the materiall cauſe of deah. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.</note> and heere he denieth it to bee the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of death, that death ſhoulde bee imputed to it. In the ſeconde to the Corinthians hee ſpeaketh more freely of the lawe, where hee calleth it the adminiſtration of death. Howe be it that hee doeth, as it is wont to bee, in the heate of diſputation: not reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nature of the lawe, but the opinion of the aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea ſinne,</hi> vnder the correction of others, I thinke it is to bee reade as I haue put it downe: and therefore I ſuppoſe this to be the ſence, ſinne in a maner is iuſtified, before it be detected by the law: but when by occaſion of the law it is reueiled, then truely it taketh the name of ſinne: and ſo much the more miſchieuous
<pb facs="tcp:7612:100"/>
and (that I may ſaye ſo) ſinnefull it appeareth then, becauſe it conuerteth the goodneſſe of the law being peruerted to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For that muſt needes bee a very poyſonable thing, which cauſeth that, which otherwiſe by his owne nature is hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to be hurtfull. The meaning is, that it was meete the outragiouſneſſe of ſinne ſhoulde be diſcouered by the lawe: for except, ſinne did (as they ſay) burſt forth by an outragious, and enormious exceſſe, it ſhoulde not bee acknowledged for ſinne.</p>
               <p>This exceſſe doeth powre out it ſelfe more violently, whiles it conuerteth life into death. Therefore, then is all excuſe taken away.</p>

                  <hi>14 For we knowe.</hi> Nowe hee beginneth more neerely to campare the lawe with the nature of man, that it might more clearely appeare, whence the fault of death proceedeth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee propoundeth an example of a regenerate man: in whom the reliques of the fleſhe doe ſo diſſent from the law of the Lord, that yet the ſpirite doeth willingly obey the ſame lawe. But firſt of all (as wee ſaide) hee ſetteth downe a bare compariſon of mans nature and the lawe. Seeing there is no greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in the worlde, then of the ſpirite and the fleſhe: the lawe is ſpirituall, man is carnall. What concorde then hath the nature of man with the lawe? namely ſuche as the light hath with darkeneſſe.<note place="margin">How the lawe is called ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> Furthermore, whereas he calleth the lawe ſpirituall, thereby hee doeth not onely ſignifie that it requireth the inwarde affections of the heart (as many expounde it): but according to the nature of an <hi>antitheſis,</hi> it hath a ſignification contrary to the worde carnall. The former interpreters wee ſpake of expounde it thus, <hi>the lawe is ſpirituall,</hi> that is, it doth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7612:100"/>
not onely binde our handes and feete, in reſpect of externall actions: but alſo is impoſed vpon the affections of the heart, and requireth the ſincere feare of God. But heere is expreſſed an <hi>antitheſis</hi> or contrarietie betweene the fleſhe and the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Finally, by the text it may ſufficiently appeare, and partly it hath been alreadie declared, that vnder the name of fleſhe, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended what ſo euer men bring with them out of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe. And men being taken for ſuch as they are borne, and for ſuch as they be ſo long as they reteyne their owne witte, are called fleſhe: for as they are corrupt, ſo they neither ſauoure nor breathe any thing, but that is groſſe and earthly.<note place="margin">Spirite put for the renewing of our corrupt nature.</note> On the contrary the ſpirite is called the renewing of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whiles God reformeth vs to his image. And hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that kind of ſpeech, becauſe that newnes which is wrought in vs is the gift of the ſpirite. Wherefore the integritie of the doctrine of the lawe, is ſet againſt the corruption of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The meaning therefore is, the lawe requireth a certaine celeſtiall, and angelicall righteouſnes, wherein there ſhoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare no blot, to whoſe cleanneſſe nothing ought to be wanting: but I carnall man can doe nothing but ſtriue againſt it. And that interpretation of <hi>Origen,</hi> which notwithſtang before this time, it hath pleaſed many, is vnworthie to be refuted. Hee ſaith the lawe is called ſpirituall of Paule, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not litterally to bee vnderſtoode. What is this vnto the preſent cauſe? <hi>ſould vnder ſinne.</hi> By this parcell he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what fleſhe is of it ſelfe. For by nature, man is no leſſe the bondeſlaue of ſinne,<note place="margin">What men are by nature.</note> then thoſe bondemen are bought with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whom their maſters abuſe at their pleaſure, like Oxen or Aſſes: wee are ſo vtterly maſtered vnder the power of ſinne, that our whole minde, heart, and all our actions bende towardes ſinne. I doe alway except coaction: for voluntarily we ſinne, becauſe it were no ſinne, excepte it were voluntarie. But wee are ſo addicted vnto ſinne, that wee can doe nothing freely but ſinne: becauſe that corruption ruleth in vs, draweth vs hereunto. Wherefore this ſimilitude importeth not (as they ſay) a coacted or forced aſtriction or tying, but a voluntary obſequie, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ingraffed ſeruitude addicteth vs.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:101"/>
                  <hi>15 For that which I doe I knowe not.</hi> Nowe hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth vnto a more particular example of a regenerate man: in whom, both thoſe thinges hee intendeth, doe more clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: namely, howe great diſcorde there is betweene the lawe of God, and mans nature, and howe the lawe doeth not of it ſelfe bring death. For truely ſeeing the carnall man, with all the inclination of his minde, doeth ruſhe into the luſt of ſinning, hee ſeemeth to ſinne with ſuch free election, that hee might mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe if hee woulde: as this pernitious opinion hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt preuayled with all men, namely, that a man by his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtrength, without the help of Gods grace, is able to electe whither hee will. But verely whiles the will of a faithfull man is ledde vnto good by the ſpirite of God, thereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainely the corruption of nature, which obſtinately reſiſteth and ſtriueth to the contrary. Therefore thou haſte in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man a very fit example, whereby thou mayeſt knowe, howe contrary the righteouſneſſe of the lawe is, to our nature. Hence alſo the declaration of the other member is more aptly drawen, then from the bare conſideration of mans nature. For the lawe, becauſe it bringeth foorth nothing but death in that man whiche is altogether carnall, is there more eaſily charged: for it is doubtfull whence the faulte proceedeth. In the regenerate man it bringeth forth holeſome fruites: whereby appeareth, that the fleſhe onely is in the cauſe, that it quickneth not: ſo farre is it from generating death of it ſelfe. That this diſputation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maye both more faithfully and more certainely bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode,<note place="margin">We begin not to ſtriue againſt ſin before we be indewed with the ſpirite of ſanctification</note> wee muſt note, that this conflicte of the which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, is not in any man, before he be ſanctified by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God. For man being left to his owne nature, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caried without reſiſtance vnto concupiſcences: for although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked are tormented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſting of their conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; can not ſo flatter themſelues in their vyces, but that they haue ſome taſte of bitterneſſe: yet thou canſt not gather thereby, that they eyther hate euill, or loue that is good. Onely the Lorde doeth ſuffer them to bee ſo tormented, that he might partly ſhewe vnto them his iudgement: not that hee might put into them, eyther a loue of righteouſneſſe, or hatred of ſinne.</p>
               <p>This difference therefore there is betweene them and the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7612:101"/>
that they (meaning the wicked) are neuer ſo blinded,<note place="margin">A difference be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween the ſting of ſinne in the wicked, &amp; the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſinne in the godly.</note> and hardened in their mindes, but if they be admoniſhed of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, in the iudgement of their owne conſcience they condemne them. For knowledge is not vtterly extinguiſhed in them, but they reteine a difference of right and wrong. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alſo through the feeling of their ſinne they are ſo ſhaken with horrour, that euen in this life they ſuſtaine a kinde a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Neuertheleſſe they like ſinne with their whole heart: and therfore without any true reſiſtaunce of the affection, they giue them ſelues vnto it.</p>
               <p>For thoſe ſtinges of conſcience wherewith all they are ſtonge, ariſe rather of the contradiction of iudgement, then the contrary affection of the will. On the contrarie the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in whome the regeneration of GOD is begunne, are ſo diuided, that with a ſpeciall deſire of the heart they feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſpire vnto GOD, they couette celeſtiall righteouſneſſe, and hate ſinne: but agayne by the reliques of their fleſhe they are drawen towardes the earth. Therefore whiles they are thus deſtracted, they fight againſt their nature, and their nature fighteth againſt them. And they doe not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their ſinnes, becauſe they are forced thereunto by the iudgement of reaſon: but becauſe from the very heart they abhorre them, and are diipleaſed with them. This is that Chriſtian warrefare, betweene the fleſhe and the ſpirite, of the whiche Paule ſpeaketh to the Galathians.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> And therefore is it well ſayde, that the carnall man with the whole conſente, and agreement of minde doeth ruſhe into ſinne: and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion or ſtruggling, then firſt beginneth, when hee is called of the Lorde, and ſanctified by his ſpirite.</p>
               <p>For regeneration is onely begunne in this life: the remnante of the fleſhe which remayneth, doeth alwaye followe his corrupte affections, and ſo mooueth warre agaynſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The vnlearned whiche conſider not whereaboute the Apoſtle goeth, or what kinde of diſpenſation hee holdeth, do thinke that the nature of man is heere deſcribed. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuche a deſcription of humane witte there is amongeſt the Philoſophers. Howebeit the ſcripture ſetteth downe a more
<pb facs="tcp:7612:102"/>
deepe philoſophie, becauſe ſince the tyme that Adam was ſpoyled of the image of God, it ſawe nothing to remaine in the heart of man, beſides peruerſitie or frowardneſſe. So Sophiſters when they go about to define free wil, or to eſtimate of what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the ſtrength of nature is, ſeaſe vpon this place: howebeit Paule (as I ſaide) doeth not heere propounde the bare nature of man: but vnder his owne perſon, Paule deſcribeth, what, and howe great the infirmitie of the faithfull is. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was ſome time in this common errour: yet when hee had more nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſifted the place, hee did not onelie retract that, which hee had taught amiſſe, but in his firſt booke vnto Boniface, by manie ſtrong arguments hee prooueth, that it can not otherwayes bee vnderſtoode, but of the regenerate. And wee will doe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure that the readers may clearely ſee it is ſo. <hi>I knowe not.</hi> His meaning is, that he did not acknowledge thoſe woorkes, whiche hee did committe through the infirmitie of the fleſhe, for his: becauſe hee did deteſt them. Therefore it is not amiſſe that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath vſed the worde <hi>approue:</hi> but becauſe that might bee ambiguous, I choſe rather to reteine the worde, <hi>knowe,</hi> or <hi>vnderſtande.</hi> Whereby wee gather that the doctrine of the lawe is ſo agreeable, vnto right iudgement, that the faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the tranſgreſſion thereof, as a brutiſhe thing. And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Paul ſeemeth to confeſſe, that hee taught otherwiſe then the lawe commaunded, many interpreters haue been deceyued, which haue thought that hee tooke vpon him the perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: hence came that common errour, that ſome haue ſuppoſed the nature of an vnregenerate man to haue been deſcribed in this whole chapter. But Paule vnder the tranſgreſſion of the law includeth all the offences of the godly,<note place="margin">What is ment by tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</note> who, neither ſhake off the feare of God, nor ſtudie of well doing. Therefore denieth hee him ſelfe to doe that which the lawe commaundeth, becauſe hee doeth it not abſolutely, but in a maner fainteth in his indeuoure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For what I woulde doe.</hi> You maye not vnderſtand this to haue bin alway in him, as though he coulde neuer do any good: but onely he complayneth that he could not doe that he coueted: namely that he coulde not proſecute that was good, with ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie as was meete, becauſe hee was holden in a maner bond: againe, that he fainted in that wherein he would not, becauſe hee
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7612:102"/>
was feeble through the infirmitie of the fleſhe. The godly minde therefore doeth not that good it woulde,<note place="margin">Howe the godly do not that they woulde.</note> becauſe it ſtandeth not with courage as were meete: and it doth the euill it would not, becauſe it deſireth to ſtande, and falleth, or at the leaſt ſhaketh.</p>
               <p>Howebeit this will and nill, muſt bee referred vnto the ſpirite, which ought to haue the principalitie in the faithfull. Yea the fleſhe hath his will: but Paule calleth that, will, whiche hee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted with the ſpeciall affection of his heart: and hee calleth that contrary to his will, which did gayneſtande the ſame.</p>
               <p>Here verily we may gather that we ſaid, namely that Paul here intreateth of the faithful, in whom that grace of the ſpirite flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, which doth illuſtrate the conſent of a ſounde mind with the righteouſnes of the law: becauſe the fleſh can not hate ſinne.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <hi>15 And if I doe that I woulde not I conſent to the lawe.</hi> That is to ſay, whiles my heart doeth recreate it ſelfe in the law, and is delighted with the righteouſnes thereof (whiche thynge vndoubtedly commeth to paſſe, when it hath the tranſgreſſing thereof) therein it feeleth and acknowledgeth the goodneſſe of the lawe: ſo that wee are ſufficiently conuicted, yea euen by experience: that no euill is to be imputed to the lawe: Yea it woulde bee holeſome vnto men, if it happened vppon right and pure heartes.

Therefore it is as muche as if it were ſayde, in mee, ſo farre forth as of my ſelfe. For euen by the firſt woordes he condemneth him ſelfe wholly of corruption, when hee confeſſeth there dwelleth no good thing in him: then in the ſeconde place hee addeth a correction, leaſt he ſhoulde bee contumelious agaynſt the grace of God, whiche did alſo dwell in him: but was no part of the fleſhe. And here againe hee confirmeth that he ſpeaketh not of euery man, but onely of the faythfull man, who through the reliques of the fleſhe, and grace of the ſpirite is diuided in him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For to what purpoſe were this correction, excepte ſome parte were free from faulte? and therefore not carnall. Vnder the name of fleſhe hee alwayes comprehendeth all the gyftes of mans nature, and alſo what ſo euer is in man, beſides the ſanctification of the ſpirite.

And ſo alſo vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which followeth, namely, to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil he would not: becauſe the fleſh of the godly doth not onely let them, that they cannot runne ſpeedily: but alſo putteth many impedimentes in their way whereat they ſtumble. They doe it not therefore,<note place="margin">We are ſaid, not to doe that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we doe not as we ſhould.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they performe it not with ſuche alacritye as were meete. Wherefore this will he ſpeaketh of, is the readineſſe of faith, whyles the holy ſpirite doth ſo frame the godly, that they are redie, and ſtudie to giue theyr members to obey the Lorde. And becauſe their ſtrength is not ſufficient, Paule ſaith, hee founde not that were to bee wiſhed: namely the effecte of a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>Heereunto apperteineth the confeſſion that next followeth: namely, that hee did not the good hee woulde, but rather the euyll which hee woulde not: namely, becauſe the faithfull, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they bee right minded, yet beeing priuie to theyr owne infirmitie, they eſteeme no worke to proceede from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faulte. For ſeeing Paule intreateth not heere of a fewe faultes of the Godly, but in generall noteth the whole courſe of their life, wee gather that their beſt woorkes are alwaye ſtayned with ſome blot of ſinne: ſo that no reward is to be hoped for, but ſo farre forth as God doeth pardon them.</p>
               <p>Finally, hee repeateth that ſentence, namely that ſo farre forth as hee is indued with celeſtiall light, hee is a faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſubſcriber to the righteouſneſſe of the lawe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it followeth, that if wee had the pure integritie of nature, the lawe ſhoulde not bee deadly vnto vs: for the lawe is not aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante to that man, who being of a ſounde minde, abhorreth from ſinne.

               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:7612:104"/>The lawe of God calleth man vnto the rule of righteouſnes: iniquitie which is (as it were) a tyrannicall lawe of Sathan, pricketh forwarde vnto wickedneſſe. The ſpirite carieth vnto the obedience of the lawe of GOD: the fleſhe draweth backe vnto the contrary part. Man thus diſtracted with diuers deſires, is now in a maner diuided, &amp; of one made two men: but becauſe the ſpirite ought to holde the principalitie, hee iudgeth and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth himſelfe chiefly by that part. Therfore Paul ſaith hee was bounde captiue of his fleſh: becauſe whereas hee is yet tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and moued with euill concupiſcences: that is a coaction, in reſpect of the ſpirituall deſire which altogether reſiſteth. But the acception of the inner man and members is diligently to bee noted, which whiles many did miſtake, they haue fallen vpon this rocke. Therefore the inner man, is not ſimply taken for the ſoule, but for that ſpirituall parte of the ſoule whiche is regenerate of God: the worde members ſignifieth the other part that remayneth.<note place="margin">What is ment by members, &amp; howe the ſpirit hath the name of inner man</note> For as the ſoule is the more excellent parte of man, and the bodie the inferiour: ſo is the ſpirite more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the fleſhe. By this reaſon therefore, becauſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite occupieth the place of ſoule in man: and the fleſhe (that is, the corrupt, and contaminated ſoule) the place of bodie: ſpirite hath the name of inner man, and fleſhe the name of members.</p>
               <p>The outward man is taken in another ſenſe the ſeconde to the Corinth. But the circumſtaunce of the preſent place neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requireth that interpretation I haue put downe, and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inner, by the way of excellencie, becauſe it poſſeſſeth the heart and hidden affections, ſeeing the appetites of the fleſhe are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and as it were out of man. Or ſurely it is like, as if a man ſhoulde compare heauen with earth. For Paule by the way of contempte, vnder the name of members, noteth what ſo euer appeareth in man, that he might the better declare howe the ſecrete renouation is hidden, and couered from our ſences, ſaue ſo farre forth as it is apprehended by fayth.</p>

                  <hi>24 O wretched man.</hi> Hee windeth vp the diſputation with a vehement exclamation, whereby hee teacheth that wee are not onely to ſtriue with our fleſhe, but with continuall ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bewayle both with our ſelues, and before God our vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. And hee demaundeth not by whom hee might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, as though hee doubted, as vnbeleeuers doe, who holde not that there is one onely deliuered. But it is the voyce of one panting, and almoſt fanting, becauſe hee doeth not ſufficiently ſee preſent helpe. And therefore hath he vſed the word <hi>take</hi> or <hi>deliuer,</hi> that hee might ſhewe howe there is required vnto this deliueraunce a ſpeciall power of God. <hi>By the body of death,</hi> Hee meaneth the maſſe of ſinne,<note place="margin">What is ment by the body of death.</note> or heape whereon man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted: ſauing that in him there remained onely certayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, with whoſe bondes hee was holden captiue. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>of this,</hi> which I with <hi>Eraſmus</hi> haue referred vnto bodie, may alſo fitly bee applied vnto death, but almoſt in the ſame ſence: becauſe the minde of Paule is to ſhewe, that the eyes of the ſonnes of God are opened, that they might pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcerne from the lawe of God, the corruption of their nature, and death which proceedeth thence. Howe bee it the name body, is all one with the name externall man, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for Paul noteth this to bee the originall of ſinne, that man is fallen from the lawe of his creation, and ſo is become carnall and earthly. For although hee doe yet excell bruite beaſtes, yet his true dignitie is taken from him: and that which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, is filled with innumerable corruptions: ſo that his ſoule, as it is degenerate,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> may be ſaid to be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into a body. So god ſaith with Moſes, my ſpirit ſhall ſtriue no more with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he is but fleſh: where by the way of reproch, he compareth man

being ſpoyled of his ſpirituall dignitie, vnto brute beaſtes. And this place of Paul ſerueth notably to beate downe all the glory of fleſhe. For it teacheth, that the moſt perfect men of all, ſo long as the dwell in their fleſhe, are addicted vnto miſerie, becauſe they are ſubiect vnto death: yea, whiles they doe diligently examine them ſelues, they finde nothing in their nature but miſerie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, leaſt they ſhoulde cocker their dulneſſe, by his example Paule prouoketh them vnto carefull morninges, and commaundeth them ſo long as they wander in earth, to deſire death as the onely remedie of their euill. And this is the right ende of coueting or deſiring death.<note place="margin">Why and howe the godly may wiſh for death.</note> For oftentimes deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on driueth prophane men vnto the ſame deſire: but rather for the lothſomneſſe of this preſent life, then for the wearineſſe of their ſinne, they doe wickedly wiſhe for death. Adde alſo that the faithfull albeit they leuell at the true marke, yet they are not caried with an vnbridled or outragious paſſion to wiſhe for death, but ſubmitte themſelues to the will of God, to whom we ought to liue and die. Wherefore they doe not rage with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation agaynſt God, but they do humbly lay their griefes in his boſome: for they doe not ſo ſtay or reſt in the cogitations of their miſeries, but being mindefull of the grace receiued, they temper their ſorrowe with mirth as it followeth,</p>
               <p n="25">
                  <hi>25 I thanke God.</hi> Hee therefore addeth this thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing ſtraightwayes, leaſt any ſhoulde thinke hee murmured ſtubbornely againſt God in his complaint. For wee know how eaſie it is, yea euen in iuſt dolour or ſorrowe to fall vnto mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring or impatiencie. Notwithſtanding therefore Paule bewayling his eſtate, did feruently couet death: yet he confeſſeth him ſelfe to reſt in the grace of God. For it is not meete that the Saintes whiles they examine their owne imperfections, ſhoulde forgette what they haue receyued of God. Finally, this cogitation ſufficeth to bridle impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, and nouriſh peace, namely that they are receiued into the cuſtodie of God, to the ende they ſhoulde neuer periſh: and euen nowe feele them ſelues indued with the firſt fruites of the ſpirite, which aſſureth them of the eternal inheritaunce. And albeit they do not yet inioy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed glory of heauen: yet they being content with that meaſure which they haue obtayned, neuer want matter of ioy.</p>

ſanctifie them vnto true puritie. He addeth, that it quickeneth (for the Genetiue caſe after the maner of the Hebrewes) is taken for an <hi>Epitheton</hi>) whereupon it followeth that who ſo deteineth a man in the letter of the law, maketh him ſubiect vnto death.

The law of God is as it were placed in the midſt: which law teacheth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, but giueth it not: yea rather it bindeth vs in ſtronger bonds vnto the ſeruitude of ſin &amp; death. Therefore the meaning is, where as the law of God condemneth men, that commeth to paſſe, becauſe ſo long as they abide vnder the bonde of the lawe, they are preſſed with the bondage of ſin: and ſo are gilty of death. But the ſpirit of Chriſt, whiles by correcting the inordinat luſts of the fleſh,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> he aboliſheth the law of ſin in vs, doth alſo deliuer vs from the giltines of death.

And Paule denieth vs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that by the doctrine of the lawe, but whiles we are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirite of God, wee are alſo iuſtified by free forgiuenes, that the curſe of ſinne might no more lie vpon vs. This ſentence therfore is as much, as if Paul had ſaid, the grace of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neuer ſeparated trom the imputation of righteouſneſſe. I dare not take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of ſin &amp; death with ſome, for the loue of god, becauſe it ſeemeth to bee a hard ſpeech.

As for the particle <hi>en O,</hi> which Eraſmus hath turned, <hi>that part wherein,</hi> becauſe I thinke it to be cauſall, I chooſe rather to tranſlate it, <hi>becauſe.</hi> And albeit perhaps you ſhall not finde ſuch a phraſe of ſpeech with good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of the Greeke tongue: yet becauſe the Apoſtles do euery where vſe Hebrewe phraſes, this interpretation ought not to ſeeme hard. Certainly the ſound Readers will graunt, that the cauſe of defect was expreſſed here, as we ſhal declare again a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after. Now whiles <hi>Eraſmus</hi> putteth down of himſelf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall verbe, in my iudgement the text doth runne verye well o-otherwiſe. The Coniunction <hi>Kai</hi> and, hath deceiued <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that he ſhould inſert or thruſt in the verbe <hi>Praeſtitit:</hi> that is, hee hath perfourmed. But I think it was put for amplification ſake, except any perhaps like the coniecture of the Greeke gloſer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ioyneth this member, <hi>and of ſinne,</hi> to that goeth before: namely, <hi>God ſent his ſonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, &amp; for ſinne.</hi> Howebeit, I haue followed that, which I haue thought to bee the naturall ſenſe of Paule. Nowe I come vnto the thing it ſelfe. Paule affirmeth plainely, that our ſinnes were therefore done away by the death of Chriſt, becauſe it was
<pb facs="tcp:7612:108"/>
impoſſible for the lawe to make vs righteous. Whereupon it followeth, there is more commaunded in the lawe, then we are able to perfourme: becauſe if wee were able to perfourme the lawe, it were in vaine to ſeeke for remedie els where. Wherefore it is abſurde that mans ſtrength ſhoulde bee meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the precepts of the lawe: as though God in requiring that is iuſte, had regarded what, and howe greate our ſtrengthe were. <hi>Becauſe it was weake.</hi> leaſt any ſhoulde thinke the law were charged vnreuerently with weakeneſſe, or ſhould reſtraine this vnto ceremonies,<note place="margin">Why the lawe cannot iuſtifie.</note> Paule hath preciſely expreſſed, that that defect is not through the fault of the lawe, but through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our fleſh. For we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe if any did abſolutely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie the lawe of God, he were righteous before God. So then hee denieth not the law to be able to iuſtifie vs, in reſpect of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as which conteineth the perfect rule of righteouſneſſe: but becauſe our fleſhe doeth not compaſſe that righteouſneſſe, the whole ſtrength of the lawe falleth or vaniſheth away. So their errour, or rather dotage is refuted, who thinke the power of iuſtifiyng is taken away onely from ceremonies: when Paul plainely putting the fault in vs, declareth that hee doth finde no faulte in the doctrine.</p>
               <p>Furthermore vnderſtand the infirmitie or weakeneſſe of the lawe, as the Apoſtle is wont to vſe the woorde <hi>astheneias,</hi> not onely for a little weakeneſſe, but for impotencie: that hee might ſignifie howe the law hath no force at all to iuſtifie. Thou ſeeſt then we are vtterly excluded from the righteouſnes of workes, and therefore muſt flee vnto the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, becauſe there can be none in our ſelues. Which thing is chiefly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be knowen: for we ſhall neuer be cloathed with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of Chriſt, except firſt we know aſſuredly, that we haue no righteouſnes of our owne. The name fleſh is put alway in the ſame ſignification: namely, for our ſelues. Therefore the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature maketh the lawe of God vnprofitable to vs: becauſe whiles it ſheweth the way of life, it doth not reduce vs backe,<note place="margin">Howe God hath reſtored vs to righteouſnes by his ſonne.</note> who are running headlong vnto death. <hi>God by ſending his ſonne.</hi> Nowe he ſheweth the maner how the celeſtiall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath reſtored vs to righteouſneſſe by his ſonne: namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath condemned ſinne in the fleſh of Chriſt: that is, the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7612:108"/>
handwriting, being as it were cancelled, he hath done away the giltines, which did hold vs bound before the Lord. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſin hath brought vs into righteouſnes, becauſe the giltines being put away, we are abſolued, that God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vs iuſt. But firſt he ſaith, that Chriſt was ſent, that he might admoniſh vs how righteouſnes is not reſident in vs, ſeeing it is to be ſought for in another: and in vaine doe men truſt to theyr merites, who are not otherwiſe iuſtified then by prayer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie: or els becauſe the borrowe righteouſnes of that ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Chriſt fulfilled in his fleſh: and he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt came in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh: becauſe albeit the fleſh of Chriſt was ſtained with no blots, yet to the ſighte it ſeemed ſinneful, ſo far foorth as he ſuſteined that puniſhment was due to our ſinnes. And certainly vpon the ſame fleſh, as ſubiect vnto him, death did ſhew all the partes of his power, And becauſe it behooued our high prieſt by his own experience to learn what it is to ſuccour the weak: Chriſt would vndertake our infirmities, that he might be the redier vnto mutual paſſion: in whiche part alſo there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a certain image of ſinfull nature. <hi>Yea of ſin:</hi> I haue ſaid a while agoe, that this was expounded by ſome, of the cauſe or end why God did ſend his ſonne: namely, that he might make ſatiſfaction for ſin. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> &amp; diuers after him, vnderſtande it ſomwhat more hardly: namely, that ſin was condemned of ſin, becauſe it ſlewe Chriſt vniuſtly &amp; vnworthily. Indeed I confeſſe, becauſe he being iuſt and innocent, vndertooke puniſhment for ſinners, by this meanes was the price of redemption paid:<note place="margin">Sinne taken for the ſacrifice of ſinne.</note> yet I cannot be brought to thinke the word <hi>ſinne</hi> to be put heere in any other ſenſe, then for a ſacrifice of ſatiſfaction, whiche of the Hebrews is called <hi>Aſham,</hi> as the Grecians cal <hi>Catharma,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whereunto malediction or curſe is annexed. So the ſame Paul ſaith, Chriſt who knew not ſin became ſin for vs, that wee might be made the righteouſnes of God in him. And the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>Peri,</hi> of or for, is taken here cauſally, as though Paul had ſaid, <hi>vpon that ſacrifice,</hi> or els, for the burden of ſin whiche was laid vpon Chriſt, ſin was caſt downe from his power, that now it might not haue vs in ſubiection. For he ſaith, that ſin was conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned metaphorically, as they who are caſt in a matter &amp; looſe their proceſſe: becauſe God dealeth no more againſt thoſe giltie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:7612:109"/>
who are cleered by the ſacrifice of Chriſte. If wee ſay, the kingdome of ſinne wherewithall wee were oppreſſed, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, it is all one. Therefore Chriſt tooke vnto him that was ours: that hee might power vpon vs that was his. For hauing taken vpon him our curſe, hee hath indued vs with his bleſſing. Here Paul addeth, <hi>in the fleſh.</hi> that our confidence might bee more ſure, whiles we ſee ſinne was conquered &amp; aboliſhed euen in our owne nature, for ſo it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that our nature is truely made partaker of that victorie: which thing hee alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth ſtraightwayes.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4 That the righteouſnes of the lawe might bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> They who gather out of this place, that thoſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by the ſpirite of Chrſte, doe fulfill the lawe, they bring in a fayned matter, altogether wide from the meaning of Paule: for the faithfull ſo long as they wander in this worlde, neuer come vnto that perfection, that the righteouſneſſe of the lawe ſhoulde bee full and perfect in them. Therefore this muſt needes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto grace, becauſe whiles the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs, the lawe is ſatiſfied that wee might bee accounted for iuſte. For the perfection which the lawe required, was therefore exhibited in the fleſhe, that the rigour thereof ſhould no more be of force to condemne vs: But becauſe Chriſte doth communicate his righteouſnes to none, but whom he hath coupled to himſelfe by the bond of his ſpirite. Regeneration is added againe, leaſte Chriſte ſhoulde bee thought to bee the miniſter of ſinne:<note place="margin">Righteouſnes by faith in Chriſte, is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</note> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ready to drawe that vnto the laſciuiouſneſſe of the fleſh, whatſoeuer is ſaide of the fatherly mercy of God: and ſome do wickedly ſlaunder this doctrine, as though it extinguiſhed the ſtudie of a right life.</p>

For ſeeing none are deliuered from the curſe, but they who lead a ſpiritual life, it might ſeeme that hope of ſaluation were cut off from all menne. For what man ſhalbe found in the worlde furniſhed with an Angelicall puritie, ſo that he hath nothing to doe with the fleſh? It was neceſſarie to adde this definition, what it is to be in the fleſhe, and to walke according to the fleſhe. At the firſt Paule doth not diſtinguiſhe ſo preciſely: but yet (as wee ſhall ſee in the proceſſe) his purpoſe is to put the faithfull in good hope, albeit they are yet tyed to their fleſh: ſo be that, they looſe not the reynes to the luſtes thereof, but ſuffer them ſelues to bee ruled by the holie ſpirite. When he ſaith, that the carnall doe care for, or meditate the thinges of the fleſhe: hee teſtifieth, that he counteth not thoſe for carnall,<note place="margin">Who are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> who aſpire vnto heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye righteouſneſſe, but who are altogether addicted to the world.</p>

Nowe in the ſeconde member, he exhorteth the faithfull to hope well, if they feele themſelues to bee lifted vppe by the ſpirite vnto the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righteouſneſſe. For whereſoeuer the ſpirite raigneth, it is a ſigne of the grace of GOD bringinge ſaluation:
<pb facs="tcp:7612:110"/>
ſeeing that the grace of God hath no place there, where the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite beyng extinguiſhed, the kingdome of the fleſh flouriſheth. But here I doe briefly make mention of that, whereof I admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed before, namely, <hi>in the fleſhe, or after the fleſhe,</hi> is as muche, as to bee voyde of the gift of regeneration.

And although Paule hath vſed the particle cauſall <hi>Gar,</hi> for, yet I doubte not but he doth ſimply confirme. For here is a kynde of conceſſion or graunting: becauſe after that he had briefly defined, what it is to be in the fleſh, now hee addeth what end remayneth. For all thoſe are giuen to the fleſh.<note place="margin">What end aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for ſuch as are ſtill carnall.</note> And ſo on the contrarie hee ſheweth, howe they are not capable of the grace of Chriſte whoſoeuer abide in the fleſh: who all their life long make haſte and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto death. And it is anotable place, wherby we may learne, how by the courſe of nature we ruſh headlong into death: becauſe we conceiue nothing of our ſelues, but that whiche is deadly. And ſtraightwaies he hath oppoſed the contrary member, that he might teach, if any part of vs tend vnto life, then the ſpirite ſheweth foorth his vertue: becauſe there commeth no ſparkle of life from our fleſh.

For whatſoeuer the ſpirite of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in vs, it appertayneth to our bleſſedneſſe: yet it followeth not that any ſhould therefore aſcribe ſaluation vnto works. For although God doth begin our ſaluation in vs, &amp; at the length do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth accompliſhe it, by faſhioning vs to his likeneſſe, yet the onely cauſe is his good pleaſure, whereby hee maketh vs partakers of Chriſt</p>

hee addeth a confirmation of that he put downe before: namely, that nothing proceedeth from the ſtudies of our fleſhe, but death: becauſe they fight fiercely with the will of God. And the will of God, is the rule of rigteouſneſſe: whereupon it followeth, that that is vniuſte whatſoeuer diſagreeth from the ſame: and if it bee vniuſte, then is it alſo deadly.</p>
               <p>Nowe then God beeing againſt it, and offended, in vayne doth any looke for life. For after his wrath muſt needes foorth with followe death, which is the reuengement of his wrath.<note place="margin">Mans carnall will is in all things contrary to the will of God.</note> And heere let vs obſerue, that the will of man is in all thinges contrary to the will of God.

For in the lawe hee ſheweth what doeth pleaſe him: they therefore that will rightlye examine, howe rightly they agree with God, let them apply all their counſayles and ſtudies vnto this rule. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though nothing bee doone in the worlde but by the direction of the ſecrete prouidence of God, yet vnder pretence of this, to ſay that nothing is done but God doth allowe of it, is intollerable blaſphemie: where about certaine phrenſie perſons cauill at this day.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this place teacheth, that Paule by the name of ſpirite, meant not the minde or vnderſtanding (whiche of the Patrones of free will is called the more excellent part of the ſoule) but the heauenly gift.

For they who pull Chriſt away from his ſpirite, make him like vnto a dead image or carkaſſe. And alway
<pb facs="tcp:7612:112"/>
wee are to remember that counſaile of the Apoſtle: namelye, that free remiſſion of ſinnes cannot bee ſeparated from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of regeneration: becauſe this were as a man woulde ſaye, to rent Chriſte in peeces.

He ſaith that was giuen in olde time vnto feare,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.18.</note> and this at this day vnto aſſuraunce. By ſuch compariſon of contraries, the certaintie of our ſaluation is (as thou ſeeſt) made more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. The authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, when hee ſaith, wee are not come vnto the mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where all thinges were ſo terrible, that the people being ouerthrowen (as it were) with the preſent ſentence of death, did pray they might not bee ſpoken vnto, yea Moſes him ſelfe confeſſed hee was afrayde: but we are come vnto <hi>Sion</hi> the hill of the Lorde, and his citie the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where is the mediatour of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ieſus. By the aduerbe, <hi>agayne,</hi> wee gather that the law is heere compared with the Goſpell: becauſe the ſonne of God by his comming brought vnto vs this ineſtimable benefite, that the ſeruile condition of the lawe ſhould no more binde vs. Yet thou mayeſt not gather hereby, eyther, that none had the ſpirite of adoption before the comming of Chriſt: or that who ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the lawe were ſeruauntes and not ſonnes. For he doth rather compare the miniſterie of the lawe, with the diſpenſation of the Goſpell, then perſons with perſons. In deede I confeſſe that the faithfull are admoniſhed here, howe muche more liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath nowe dealte with them, then hee did in olde time with the fathers vnder the olde Teſtament: yet hee reſpecteth the externall diſpenſation, in reſpecte whereof onely wee excell: becauſe howeſoeuer the ſayth of Abraham, Moſes, and Dauid, was more excellent then ours: yet for as muche as God in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner kept them vnder a ſchoolemiſtreſſe, they were not yet come vnto that libertie, which is opened vnto vs. And alſo it is to bee noted, that I haue purpoſely (becauſe of falſe Apoſtles) put an <hi>antitheſis</hi> or contrarietie betweene the litterall diſciples of the lawe, and the faithfull, whome Chriſt the heauenly maiſter doeth not onely ſpeake vnto with ſounde of mouth, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardely doeth teache effectually by his ſpirite. And although the couenaunt of grace is conteined in the lawe, yet he remoueth it thence: becauſe oppoſing the Goſpell, hee conſidereth nothing but that which was proper to the lawe, namely to bidde and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the denouncing of death to bridle ſinners: and ſo hee giueth vnto the lawe,<note place="margin">What was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the lawe.</note> that qualitie whereby it differeth from the Goſpell. Or if any had rather, hee propoundeth the bare
<pb facs="tcp:7612:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lawe, as God therein couenanteth with vs in reſpect of workes. Thus therfore we are to thinke of the perſons amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of the Iewes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law was publiſhed, &amp; alſo after it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly were illuminated w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame ſpirit of faith: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hope of eternall inheritance (whereof the ſpirite is a pledge &amp; ſeale) was ſealed in their heart. Here onely is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the ſpirite is powred out more aboundantly &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in the kingdome of Chriſt. But if thou haſt regarde vnto the diſpenſation of doctrine, ſaluation ſhall ſeeme to haue been then for a ſuertie firſt manifeſted, when Chriſt was exhibited in the fleſh, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch obſcuritie were all thinges couered vnder the old Teſtament, in compariſon of that light is vnder the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if the lawe be conſidered in it ſelfe, it can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but binde men, that are ſubiect to miſerable ſeruitude, with the horrour of death: becauſe it promiſeth no good thing, but with condition: and it denounceth death againſt all tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. Wherefore as vnder the lawe there was the ſpirite of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which preſſed the conſcience with feare: ſo vnder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell there is the ſpirite of adoption, whiche cheereth our ſoules with the teſtimonie of our ſaluation. And obſerue that feare is ioyned to bondage, becauſe it can not otherwiſe be, but the law ſhould with wonderful diſquietnes vexe and torment our ſoules, ſo long as it exerciſeth his power.<note place="margin">How feare is ioyned with bondage.</note> Wherefore there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedie for the quieting of them, then whiles God forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our offences, doeth fauour vs as a father his children. <hi>By whome wee crye Abba.</hi> Hee hath therefore changed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that hee might expreſſe the ſtate of all the godly: as though hee ſayde, yee haue receiued the ſpirite, whereby, you as well as wee and the reſidue of all the faithfull, doe crye.

The doubling of the name by diuers woordes, contayneth an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>For Paule giueth to vnderſtande that the mercie of God is nowe ſo publiſhed through the whole worlde, that he is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently prayed vnto in all tongues: as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> noteth.</p>
               <p>Therefore his meaning was to expreſſe the conſent amongſt all

nations. Whereuppon it followeth that nowe there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene Iewe and Gentile, ſeeing they are knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether amongſt them ſelues. The Prophete Eſay ſpeaketh otherwiſe, ſaying, that the tongue of Chanaan, ſhoulde bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto all: yet all one ſence,<note place="margin">Eſai. 19.18.</note> becauſe he reſpecteth not the externall fourme of ſpeeche, but the conſent of heart in woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, and the ſame, and ſimple ſtudie in profeſſing his true and pure woorſhippe. The woorde <hi>crie</hi> is put to expreſſe the conſtancie, as if hee ſayde, wee pray not, doubtingly,<note place="margin">What is ment by crying vnto God.</note> but boldely wee lift vp our voyce vnto heauen.</p>
               <p>In deede the faythfull vnder the lawe did call God father, but not with ſuch ſure confidence, ſeeing the vayle did driue them farre from the ſanctuarie: but nowe when an entraunce is opened vnto vs by the blood of Chriſt, wee may familiarly, and as it were with full mouth glorie that wee are the ſonnes of God: from whence this crye proceedeth. Finally by this the propheſie of Oſee is fulfilled, I will ſay vnto them: <hi>you are my people:</hi> and they ſhall anſwer agayne, <hi>thou art our God.</hi>

For in that the creatures are ſubiect vnto corruption, and that not by a naturall appetite, but by the ordinaunce of God. Secondly in that they haue hope, in time to come to put of corruption, it followeth they mourne as a woman trauayling, vntyll they be deliuered. And it is a moſt apte and fitte ſimilitude, that wee might knowe, this mourning whereof hee ſpeaketh is not vaine nor deade: becauſe at length it ſhall bring foorth a ioyfull and happie fruite.

Hereunto apperteyneth the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our body which is ſtraightwaies added. For the price of our redemption was ſo paid of Chriſt, that death neuertheles might hold vs yet bound in his bonds: yea we carrie it within vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth that the ſacrifice of the death of Chriſt, ſhoulde be in vayne and fruitles, except there appeared fruite in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial renouation.</p>
               <p n="24">
                  <hi>24 For we are ſaued by hope.</hi> Paul confirmeth his exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by an other argument. Namely, becauſe our ſaluation cannot be ſeparated from a kinde of death, which he proueth by the nature of hope. For ſeeing hope extendeth it ſelfe vnto things not yet knowen by experience, and repreſenteth vnto our mindes the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of things which are hid and farre off, whatſoeuer is either openly ſeene, or holden with the hand, cannot be hoped for. But Paule taketh it for a thing ſo grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that it cannot be denied, ſo long as we liue in this worlde, our ſaluation ſtandeth in hope: whereby it followeth that it is laide vp with God, farre aboue our ſences. Whereas he ſaith that is no hope which is ſeene, it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7612:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is verily a hard ſpeeche, but yet ſuch as obſerueth not the ſence, for he goeth about ſimply to teach, ſeeing hope is of good things to come, &amp; not preſent, it can neuer be ioyned with manifeſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.

                  </gap> euert the order is ſet downe of God, who doeth not call his vnto the triumph before he haue exerciſed them in the warfare of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferance. But ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to nouriſh our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it were ſecretly in his boſome, it is expedient for vs to labour in earth, to be oppreſſed, to mourne, to be afflicted, yea to lye as it were halfe dead, or like vnto thoſe are dead. For they who couet a viſible ſaluation, they put them ſelues by it, renouncing hope which is ordeyned of God to be the keeper of it.</p>
               <p n="25">
                  <hi>25. But if we hope for that we ſee not.</hi> This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the antecedent to the conſequent: becauſe pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence neceſſarily followeth hope. For if it be grieuous to wante the good thing thou deſireſt: vnles thou ſupport and comfort thy ſelfe by patience, thou muſt fall by deſperation. So then hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way draweth patience with it. So it is a moſt fitte concluſion, namely, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doth vanquiſh away whatſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of the glorie of the reſurrection, except by bearing the croſſe and tribulations patiently, we paſſe through this preſent life. For it life be inuiſible, then we muſt haue death before our eyes if glorie be inuiſible, then ignominy is preſent. Therfore if thou wilt compriſe this place in fewe wordes,<note place="margin">The ſaluation of the godly is laid vp in hope.</note> thou maieſt digeſt the argumentes of Paule into this forme. Saluation is layde vp in hope for all the faithfull: it is the propertie of hope, to inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon good thinges to come, and which are abſent: therefore the ſaluation of the godly is hidden vp.

There is no cauſe then, why any ſhould complayne, that the bearing of the croſſe is aboue their ſtrength, ſeeing we are ſtrengthened by vertue from aboue.

brought vpon this place, yet the meaning of Paule ſeemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, to be ſimply thus, that we are blinde in praying vnto God: becauſe although we feele our euils, yet our mindes are more intricated and confounded, then that they can rightly elect what is conuenient or expedient. If any man except,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is a rule preſcribed vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God: I anſweare, our affections neuertheleſſe abide oppreſſed with darknes,<note place="margin">Anſweare.</note> vntil the ſpirit direct them by his light. <hi>But the ſpirite it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs.</hi> Although indeed or by the euent it appeareth not as yet, that our prayers are hard of God, neuertheleſſe, Paule gathereth that euen in the very ſtudie of praying the preſence of Gods grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhyneth, becauſe no man of himſelfe can conceiue holy and godly prayers. Indeede the faithleſſe babble prayers, but with meere mocking of God: becauſe there is nothing in them, either ſincere, or ſerious, or rightly compoſed. Wherefore the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of praying wel muſt needes be caught of the ſpirite: he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calleth thoſe ſighes vneuarrable, wherinto we burſt through the vehement motion of the ſpirite: becauſe they farre exceede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> capacity of our wit. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God is ſaide to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs, not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> indeed humbly kneeling it doth abaſe it ſelfe to pray or mourne,<note place="margin">How the ſpirits is ſaid to make interceſſion for vs.</note> but becauſe it ſtirreth vp thoſe prayers in our hearts, wherewithall it is meete wee ſhoulde bee touched: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it doth ſo moue our hearts that with their feruencie they pearce vnto the very heauen. And Paul ſpake ſo to the ende hee might more ſignificantly attribute al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto the grace of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit. Indeede we are bidden knocke, but no man can of himſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate one ſillable, vnles by the ſecrete inſtinct of his ſpirite, God knocke vpon vs, and ſo open our hearts vnto him.</p>

                  <hi>27 But he that ſearcheth the heartes, knoweth the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> This is a notable reaſon to confirme our faith or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that wee are hearde of God, whiles wee praye by his ſpirite. For hee knoweth familiarly our deſires, as the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his ſpirite. And heere the proprietie of the woorde, <hi>knowe,</hi> is to be noted: for it ſignifieth that God doth not conſider thoſe motions of the ſpirit as new and inſolent, or reiect them as abſurde: but acknowledge them, and alſo graciouſly receiue them as knowen to him &amp; approued of him. Therfore as Paule teſtified of late, that God doth then helpe vs, whiles hee doeth
<pb facs="tcp:7612:121"/>
as it were bring vs into his owne boſome: ſo now he addeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſolation, namely, that our prayers, whereof he is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour, are not in vayne. The reaſon alſo is added ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: becauſe in ſo doing he conformeth vs to his wil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it falleth out that that cannot be in vaine, which is agreeing to his wil, whereby althinges are gouerned. Here alſo wee may learne that conſent with the will of God, is the chiefeſt thing in prayer, which conſent our owne deſires holde not faſt tied vnto them. Wherefore if we would haue our prayers acceptable vnto God, let vs beſeeche him to moderate them according to his will.</p>

                  <hi>28 Alſo we know.</hi> Out of the premiſſes he now concludeth, that the miſeries of this life are ſo farre from hindering our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that rather they further it. Neither letteth it, that he hath put the particle illatiue, ſeeing it is no noualtie with him, ſo to confound aduerbs: although this concluſion doeth alſo conteyne a <hi>Preoccupation.</hi> For here the ſence of fleſh exclaimeth, that it appeareth not God doth heare our prayers, ſeeing our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceed alway in the ſame courſe. Therfore the Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth that, ſaying, although God doth not by and by helpe his, yet he doeth not forſake them; becauſe by a wonderfull ſkill, hee turneth thoſe things to their ſaluation, which ſeemed diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. If any had rather read this ſentence by it ſelfe, as though Paule went about by a new argument, to proue that aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which further our ſaluation, are not heauily and grieuouſly to be borne, I doe not gainſtande it. In the meane while the counſell of Paule is not bſcure, although the elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7612:121"/>
are indifferently ſubiect to the like euils, yet there is great difference: becauſe God inſtructing the faithfull by afflictions, doth procure their ſaluation. And wee are to remember that Paule ſpeaketh not but of aduerſities: as though he ſayd, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things happen to the godly,<note place="margin">Aduerſities by the prouidence of God, are made commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> they are ſo tempered from aboue, that that which the world thinketh to be hurtfull, the iſſue declareth it to be profitable. For albeit that is true <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth, euen ſinnes through the direction of Gods prouidence, are ſo farre from hurting the Saintes, that they ſerue rather to their health: yet it apperteyneth not vnto this place, where he intreateth of the croſſe. And note that he hath comprehended the ſumme of pietie vnder the loue of God: as indeede the whole ſtudie of righteouſnes dependeth thereon. <hi>To thoſe who are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> This parcell ſeemeth to be added by the way of correction: leaſt any ſhould thinke that the faithfull, becauſe they loue God, doe obteyne by their deſert, that they receiue ſuch fruite by aduerſities. For we know when the matter of ſaluation is in hand, men woulde gladlye beginne at them ſelues, and fayne vnto themſelues preparations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may preuent the grace of God. Therefore Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that thoſe whom he called the woorſhippers of God, were elected before of him. For it is ſure the order is therefore noted, that we might know whereas all thinges fall out for the health of the Godly, that dependeth vpon the free adoption of God, as the firſt cauſe. Yea Paule ſheweth, that the faithfull loue not God, before they be called of him: as in another place he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, that the Galathians were firſt knowen of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> before they knewe him. Verily, this of Paule is true, that afflictions profite none to ſaluation, but them loue God:<note place="margin">God preuenteth vs by his grace and we doe not preuent him by our loue.</note> yet that of Iohn is as true, namely, that then at length he is begunne to be loued of vs, when he hath preuented vs by his free grace.</p>
               <p>Finally, the calling Paule ſpeaketh of here, is large. For it muſt not be reſtrayned, vnto the manifeſtation of election, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention ſhalbe made ſhortly after, but ſimply it is oppoſed to mans courſe: as though Paule had ſaid, the faithful get not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues godlineſſe by their owne motion, but rather it is brought by the hande of God, ſo farre as God hath choſen them to himſelfe for his owne. The woorde <hi>purpoſe</hi> doth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:7612:122"/>
exclude, whatſoeuer may be imagined to be brought of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as though Paule denied the cauſes of our election to be ſought for els where, then in the ſecret pleaſure of God: which thing appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more clearly out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>1.</hi> to the <hi>Ephe. 1.</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Yet it is not to be doubted, but Paul did therfore here preciſely ſay, our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is founded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the election of God, that he might thence make a paſſage vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which followeth ſtraightwaies, namely, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which make vs like vnto Chriſt are deſtinated to vs by the ſame celeſtiall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that hee might as it were by a certaine bonde of neceſſity, linke our ſaluation, with the bearing of the croſſe.</p>

                  <hi>29 Becauſe whom he foreknew.</hi> Therefore by the order of election he declareth, how all afflictions are nothing els, then a meane whereby they are conformed vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore there is no cauſe why it ſhould grieue vs, or be bitter and heauy vnto vs to bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: except we take in ill part the election of the Lord, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are foreordeined vnto life: except we be vnwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent in vs the image of the ſonne of God, whereby wee are prepared vnto the celeſtial glory. And the foreknowledge of God wherof Paul here maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">What is meant by foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> is not a bare foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as ſome vnſkilful bodies doe fooliſhly imagine: but adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherby he alway diſcerneth his ſonnes from the reprobate. In which ſence Peter ſaith, the faithfull were elected vnto the ſanctification of ſpirite, according to the foreknowledge of God. Wherfore, they I ſpake on, gather fooliſhly, that God hath elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no others, then thoſe he foreſaw to bee worthie of his grace. For Peter doth not flatter the faithfull, as though euery one were elected for his merite: but calling them vnto the eternall counſell of God, doth put them beſide all worthines. And alſo in this place, Paule repeateth by another worde, that which he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched lately concerning purpoſe. Whence it followeth that this knowledge dependeth vpon the good pleaſure of God, becauſe God foreknew nothing out of himſelfe, touching thoſe he would adopt: but only ſigned whom he would elect. The worde <hi>Proori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zein,</hi> which they tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate predeſtinate, is referred vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this place: becauſe Paule only meaneth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God hath ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7612:122"/>
decreed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whomſoeuer he hath adopted, the ſame ſhould carrie the image of Chriſt: for he did not ſimply ſay, that they might be conformed vnto Chriſt, but to the image of Chriſt: that he might ſhewe there is a liuely and manifeſt example in Chriſt, which is ſet before al the ſonnes of God to imitate. Finally, the ſumme is,<note place="margin">Chriſt is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of all the ſonnes of God.</note> that the free adoption wherein our ſaluation conſiſteth, cannot be ſeparated from this other decree, wherein he hath allotted vs to beare the croſſe: becauſe none can bee an heire of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, who firſt is not made like vnto the only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne of God. <hi>That he might be the firſt begotten, or that he ſhould be.</hi> For both wayes the Greeke infinitiue <hi>Einai</hi> may be reſolued, yet I rather allow of the former. Furthermore, in that Chriſt is called the firſt begottten, Paules mind is only to note this, if Chriſt obteyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prerogatiue amongſt al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnes of God, he is worthily giuen vnto vs for an example, that we ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe nothing, which he hath voutſafed to take vpon him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the celeſtiall father might by all meanes teſtifie the right &amp; dignity which he hath giuen vnto his ſonne, he wil haue all who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath adopted into the inheritance of his kingdome to be conformed or made like to his example. For although there be in ſhew a diuers condition of the godly, as there is ſome vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie betweene the members of a mans body: yet is euery one coupled with his head. Therfore as the firſt borne doth beare the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> family, ſo Chriſt is placed in an high degree: not only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might excel in honour among the faithful, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnder the common note of fraternity he might conteine al vnder him.</p>
               <p n="30">
                  <hi>30 And whom he hath predeſtinate, them alſo he called.</hi> Now that he might in a clearer ſort proue how true it is, that that conformation or conformitie and likelineſſe with the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Chriſt, is healthful to vs, he vſeth a gradation, wherein he teacheth, that the ſociety of the croſſe is ſo linked with our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, iuſtification &amp; glorificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſeparated. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit that the readers might better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, they are to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that, I admoniſhed before, namely,<note place="margin">What the word predeſtinate noteth.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>predeſtinate,</hi> noteth not election, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe or decree of God, wherby he hath ordeined for his a croſſe to be borne: &amp; now teaching that the ſame are called, hee ſignifieth that God doth not hold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloſe within himſelfe whiche he hath determined
<pb facs="tcp:7612:123"/>
of them, but hath diſcloſed it: that they might quietly and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently vndertake the condition laid vpon them. For here vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or calling, as the inferiour is diſtinguiſhed from ſecret electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Leaſt any therefore ſhoulde obiect, that no man knoweth what condition God hath appointed for him: the Apoſtle ſaith, God by his calling hath openly teſtified of his ſecrete counſell. And this teſtimony conſiſteth not in the ſole externall preaching, but it hath the efficacie of the ſpirit coupled: becauſe the ſpeech is of the elect, whom God doth not onely ſpeake vnto by voyce, but alſo inwardly draweth. Iuſtification might fitly be extended vnto the continuall tenour of the grace of God, euen from the tyme of our calling vnto the houre of death: but becauſe Paule in the whole Epiſtle vſeth this worde for the free imputation of righteouſnes, no neceſſitie doth compel to decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſence. For the counſel of Paule is this, that there is a more pretious reward offered, then that we ought to refuſe afflictions. For what is more to be wiſhed for, then to be reconciled to God, that our miſeries be no more tokens of malediction or curſe, neither tend to our deſtruction? Therfore he addeth ſtraightwayes, that the ſame are glorified, who are now preſſed with the croſſe, ſo that their miſeries and reproches damage them nothing at all. Although glorification is not yet exhibited but in our head, yet becauſe we doe in a manner ſee in him now the inheritaunce of eternall life, his glorie bringeth ſuch aſſuraunce of our glory to vs, that woorthely our hope is matched or compared to preſent poſſeſſion. And adde, that Paule according to the phraſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue tongue hath vſed the pretertence in the verbes, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tence. Surely it is out of queſtion, that a continuall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is noted,<note place="margin">The godly looſe as iot of glory whiles they are humbled.</note> to this ſence: whom God now after his owne counſel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth with aduerſitie, thoſe he alſo calleth and iuſtifieth into the hope of ſaluation: ſo that they looſe no iot of glorie whiles they are humbled. For albeit the preſent miſeries doe deforme it before the world: yet before God and his Angels it alwaies appeareth perfect. This therfore is the meaning of Paul by this gradation, that the afflictions of the faithfull whereby they are humbled, doe not apperteyne to any other ende, then that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obteyned the glorie of the celeſtiall kingdome, might come vnto the glorie of the reſurrection of Chriſt, with whom they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7612:123"/>
are nowe crucified.</p>

And in theſe wordes he teacheth howe that inuincible fortitude, which ouer commeth all tentations conſiſteth in the fatherly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God. For wee knowe that iudgement is woont no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be giuen of the loue or hatred of God, then by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the preſent ſtate. Therefore when thinges fall out vnhappily, ſorow poſſeſſing our mindes, it driueth away all confidence and conſolation, but Paul crieth out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beginning muſt be further ſought forth: &amp; therfore they reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who ſtay vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorowful ſpectacle of our warfare.

For this is a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen wall vnto vs, that by the fauour of God wee ſhoulde bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure againſt all daungers. Yet his meaning is not that wee ſhoulde haue no aduerſity: but he promiſeth victory againſt all ſorts of enimies</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God be on our ſide.</hi> This is the chiefe, and ſurely the onely ſtay that ſupporteth vs in all temptations. For excepte God be gracious vnto vs, although all thinges laugh vppon vs, yet no certayne truſt can be conceiued. And on the contrarye

his onely fauour is a ſufficient ſolace in all ſorowe,<note place="margin">The fauour of God the onely fountaine of all conſolation.</note> and a ſtrong defence againſt all tempeſts of aduerſities.

Indeed the <hi>Antitheſes</hi> ſeeme not to be exactly digeſted into their partes: for he ſhould rather haue oppoſed theſe two members betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. <hi>Who ſhal accuſe?</hi> It is Chriſt that maketh <hi>intercesſion.</hi> Then to haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the other two, <hi>Who ſhal condemne? It is God that iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> For the abſolution or deliuerance of God, anſwereth conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and the defence or ſupportation of Chriſt, anſweareth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. But Paul, not without cauſe, hath tranſpoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, going about to arme the ſonnes of God from top to toe (as they ſay) with the confidence of God, which might baniſh a farre off, anxieties &amp; feares. More emphatically therfore he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth that the ſonnes of God are not ſubiect to accuſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doeth iuſtifie, then if he had ſayde, becauſe Chriſte is their Patrone: for ſo he expreſſeth better howe the way is farre ſhutte vppe to iudgement, where the iudge doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce himſelfe, that he altogether exempteth him from guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, whom the accuſator woulde drawe vnto puniſhment. And there is alſo the like reaſon, of the ſecond part of the <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> or contrarietie. For he ſheweth that the faithfull are farre from the perill of condemnation, ſeeyng Chriſte by making ſatiſfaction for their ſinnes, hath preuented the iudgement of God, and by his interceſſion, hath not onely aboliſhed death, but alſo put our ſinnes out of rememe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>raunce, that they come not into account. The ſumme is, that we are not onelye by the preſent remedies, when we come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement ſeate of GOD, to be deliuered from feare: but God doeth helpe more, that he might better prouide for our confidence.</p>
               <p>Howbeit here we are to note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue alwaies admoniſhed
<pb facs="tcp:7612:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of before this, namely, that to iuſtifie with Paule, is nothing els, then being looſed from the ſentence of God,<note place="margin">What it is to iuſtifie.</note> to be counted for iuſt. And it is no harde matter to proue that in this preſent place, where Paule reaſoneth from the putting downe of one contrary vnto the deſtruction of another: if ſo that to abſolue and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for guilty be contrarie. Therfore God will not admit any accuſation againſt vs: becauſe he hath abſolued vs from euerye offence. For vndoubtedly the Diuel is the accuſer of all the godly: the lawe of God it ſelfe, and alſo their owne conſcience doth reproue them: but all theſe preuayle nothing before that iudge who doth iuſtifie them. Therefore no aduerſarie can ſhake, much leſſe ouerthrow our ſaluation. Furthermore, he ſo nameth the elect, that he doubteth nothing of himſelfe to be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them.<note place="margin">Here is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> And that not by ſpeciall reuelation (as certaine Sophiſters faine) but by the common ſence of all the godly. Let euerie one therfore of the godlie by the example of Paul, apply that vnto himſelfe which is here ſaide of the elect. Otherwiſe if he did burie election in the ſecrete counſell of God, this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine were not onely colde, but ſhould lye altogether dead. But ſeeing we know, that that is purpoſely here vttered which euery one of the godly ought to apply vnto himſelf, out of queſtion we are all of vs lead vnto the touchſtone of our vocation, that we be reſolued we are the ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p n="34">
                  <hi>34 Who ſhall condemne?</hi> As none can preuayle by accuſing, when the iudge hath abſolued: ſo there remayneth no condemnation when the lawes are ſatiſfied, and nowe the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is payde. But Chriſt is the man, who once hath ſuffered the puniſhment due vnto vs, therby profeſſing himſelfe to vndertake our turnes, that he might deliuer vs: he therfore that hereafter wil condemne vs, muſt call Chriſt himſelfe againe vnto death, And he is not only dead: but by his reſurrection hath appeared Victorer of death, and hath triumphed ouer the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And he addeth yet more, namely, that hee ſitteth at the right hand of the father:<note place="margin">How Chriſt is ſaid to fit on the right hand of the father. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.20.</note> wherby is meant, that he obteyneth the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and full authority of heauen and earth, as it is ſaid to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he teacheth that he ſitteth ſo, that he is the perpetuall aduocate, and interceſſour for the defence of our ſaluation.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7612:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whence it followeth that if any will condemne vs, he doth not only make voyde the death of Chriſt, but alſo fighteth againſt that incomparable power, wherewith the father hath adorned him, placing him in the higheſt degree with ſuch power. This ſo great boldnes, which dare triumph againſt the deuil, death, ſinn, &amp; the gates of hell, ought to reſt in al godly hearts: becauſe our faith is no faith, vnleſſe we doe certainly perſwade our ſelues that Chriſt is ours, &amp; that the father is mercifull vnto vs in him. Nothing therfore can be imagined more peſtilent, or more dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie then the ſchoole doctrine of the vncertaintie of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Who maketh incerceſſion for vs.</hi> It was neceſſary this ſhoulde bee plainly added, leaſt the diuine maieſtie of Chriſt ſhould make vs afraid. Although therfore from his high throne he holdeth all thinges in ſubiection vnder his feete, yet Paul giueth vnto him the perſon of a mediator: Of whoſe countenance to be afrayde, were abſurd, ſeeing he doth not only gently inuite vs vnto him,<note place="margin">How Chriſt is ſaid to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For he is not to be thought to beſeech his father humbly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knees, with his hands ſtretched out: but becauſe he appeareth ſtil with his death &amp; reſurrection, which are in ſteed of an eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion &amp; haue the efficacie of liuely prayer, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the father to vs, and make him intreatable, he is worthely ſaid to make interceſſion for vs.</p>

Finally, this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaning of the words, whatſoeuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, we muſt ſtand in this faith, namely that God who hath once loued vs, will neuer ceaſe to care for vs. For he doeth not ſimply ſay, there is nothing can ſeparate God from the loue of vs: but he woulde that the knowledge and liuely ſence of loue which he teſtifieth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as the cloudes, although they darken the cleare ſight of the ſonne, yet doe not altogether depriue vs of his ſhine: euen ſo God in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, ſendeth through cloudes, the beames of his grace, leaſt anie tentation ſhould ouerwhelme vs with diſpaire: yea our faith being ſupported by the promiſes of God, as by winges, ought through all impedimentes which are in the way to pearce vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heauens. Indeede it is true that aduerſities are tokens of Gods wrath, if they be eſteemed by themſelues: but when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reconciliation is gone before, we are to be reſolued, that although God doeth chaſten, yet he wil neuer forget his mercy. Verily he admoniſheth what wee haue deſerued, but withall he teſtifieth that he hath a care of our ſaluation, whiles he prouoketh vs vnto repentaunce. And he calleth it <hi>the loue of Chriſt.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the father in a manner doeth open his bowelles vnto vs in him. Seeing then the loue of God is not to bee ſought for out of Chriſt, woorthily doeth Paule call vs hither: that in the beames of the grace of Chriſt, our faith might beholde the cleere countenaunce of the Father. The ſumme is, that this faith ought not to bee ſhaken with anie aduerſitie: for God beeing gracious vnto vs, nothing is againſt vs. Whereas ſome take the loue of Chriſt <hi>pasſiuely,</hi> for that loue wherewith hee is loued of vs, as though Paule armed vs vnto inuincible fortitude: this imagination is eaſily refuted by the whole courſe of Paules ſpeeche: and ſtraight way alſo Paule will remooue all doubt heerein, by defining this loue more clearely. <hi>Tribulation? or anguiſhe? or perſecution?</hi> The Pronowne maſculine which he put downe of late, conteineth a ſecrete <hi>Emphaſis</hi> or <hi>force.</hi>

It is probable or like that the miſerable oppreſſion of the people vnder the tyrannie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus is deſcribed in that Pſalme: becauſe it is preciſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that they raged againſt the worſhippers of God ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly for no other cauſe, then for the hatred of true godlineſſe.

Neyther letteth it that hee knewe his ſaluation was grounded vppon the election of God, which can by no meanes fall away. For theſe feruent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as they are caried headlong, ſo they reſpect or conſider nothing els, but that they tende vnto. Therefore Paule did not ioyne the election of God with his wiſhe, but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that being paſt by, hee was wholly fixed vpon the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes. Nowe where as many doubt whether it were a lawfull deſire: that doubt may thus be vnfoulded: namely, that this is the perpetuallimitte of loue, that it may proceed euen vnto death. So that then if we loue in God, and not out of God: our loue ſhall neuer bee too much. And ſuch was this of Paule. For whiles hee ſawe his nation to bee indewed with ſo manye giftes of God, hee loued the giftes of God in them, and them for the giftes ſake.</p>
               <p>And alſo was verie ſory that theſe graces ſhoulde periſhe: hence came it that his minde being (as it were) confounded, hee burſt forth into this extreme wiſhe. So I receiue not their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who thinke Paule ſayde theſe in reſpect of God onely, and not in reſpect of men: agayne, neyther doe I conſent vnto thoſe, who without conſideration of God, ſay that Paul gaue ſo much vnto the loue of men: but I ioyne the loue of men with the ſtudie of the glory of God. And yet I haue not declared that, which was the principall: namely that the Iewes are here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as they are decked with their ornamentes, whereby they were diſtinguiſhed from mankind. For God by his couenant had ſo highly aduaunced them, that if they fel, the fayth and truth of God ſhould fayle or decay in the world. For the couenant had been voyde, whoſe ſtablenes is ſayd to indure,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.1.</note> ſo long as the Sun and Moone ſhall ſhine in heauen.

                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:130"/>Wherefore, it is not a ſimple and bare comparing of men: for although it were better one member ſhoulde periſhe then the whole bodie: yet Paule therefore eſteemeth the Iewes ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he giueth vnto them the perſon and (as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay) the quality of elect people. Which thing alſo appeareth better out of the text, as we ſhall ſee ſtraightwayes in his place. Theſe wordes, <hi>I ſay my kinſmen according to the fleſhe,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſignifie no new thing, yet they auayle muche vnto amplification. For firſt leaſt any ſhould thinke hee doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or voluntarily ſeeke a cauſe of debate with the Iewes, he ſignifieth that he hath not ſo put off the ſence of humanity, but he is moued at this ſo horrible a deſtruction of his owne fleſh. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſeeing the Goſpel whereof he was a preacher, muſt needs come forth of Sion, it is not without cauſe that he doth ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferre the commendation of his kinred.

                  <hi>4 Who are the Iſraelites.</hi> Here now he plainely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cauſe why the deſtruction of the people of the Iewes did ſo greatly grieue him, that he was readie to redeeme them with his owne deſtruction: namely, becauſe they were Iſraelites. For the Pronowne relatiue, is put in ſteede of an Aduerb cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. So this anguiſhe grieued Moſes, when hee deſired that he might be put out of the booke of life, that the holie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſeede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might not vtterly periſh. Therefore beſides humane affection,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.2.</note> he noteth other reaſons, and the ſame alſo greater or weightier, whiche ought to make him fauour the Iewes: namely, that the Lord had ſo aduanced them as it were by a certaine prerogatiue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort of men.

vnwoorthy, who ſhould be eſteemed of, according to theſe giftes yet Paule ceaſſeth not euen therfore to reuerence them.

But let vs imitate Paule, who graunteth vnto the Iewes their ornaments in ſuch ſort, that afterward hee declareth all to bee nothing without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Finally, he doth not in vain put this amongeſt their prayſes, that they were Iſraelites. For Iacob prayed for that in ſteede of an excellent bleſſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 48.18.</note> that his name myght bee called vppon ouer them. <hi>To whom perteineth the adoption.</hi> The whole ſpeech of Paule is directed vnto this marke. Howeſoeuer the Iewes by their fallyng away, haue made a wicked diuorcement with God, yet is not the light of the grace of God vtterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in them, as hee alſo ſayde in the thirde Chapter, although they were vnbeleeuers and truice breakers,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.3.</note> yet is not the faith of God made voyde by their vnbeliefe. Not onely becauſe hee hath reſerued out of the whole multitude a remnant vnto himſelfe, but becauſe by the right of inheritance, the name of the Churche did yet abide with them. And albeit they had nowe depriued them ſelues of all theſe ornamentes, ſo that it profited them nothing to be called the ſonnes of Abraham: yet becauſe it was dangerous, leaſt through their fault, the maieſty of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſhoulde become vile amongſt the Gentiles, Paule conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not what they deſerued, but with many vailes hee couereth their filthines and ſhame, vntil the Gentiles were perſwaded the Goſpel came vnto them from the celeſtiall fountayne, out of the priuie chappell of God, out of an elect nation. For the Lorde, all other nations being let paſſe, had ſelected them for a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people to himſelfe, and had adopted them for ſonnes, as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten teſtifieth by Moſes and the Prophetes. And not contente ſimplie to call them ſonnes, ſometime hee calleth them his firſt

I am become a father to Iſraell, and Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is my firſt born.<note place="margin">Ier. 31.9.</note> Alſo in the ſame place, Is not Ephraim my deare ſonne? Is he not my pleaſant childe? Therefore my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled ouer him, &amp; yet I wil haue compaſſion on him. By which wordes hee doeth not onely ſet foorth his fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Iſrael, but rather ſheweth the force of adoption, vnder the which the promiſe of the celeſtiall inheritance is conteined. <hi>Glory</hi> ſignifieth that excellencie whereunto the Lord had aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that people aboue al other nations: and that both by many &amp; diuers other meanes, and alſo becauſe he dwelt in the middeſt of them. For beſides many ſignes of his preſence, he gaue a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler teſtimonie therof in the arke, whence he both gaue anſweres, and alſo did heare his people,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 4.22.</note> that he might ſhew forth his power in helping them. For which cauſe it was called the glory of God. Becauſe here he hath diſtinguiſhed couenants from promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, let vs not this difference, that wee count that a conuenant, which is conceiued by plaine and ſolemne wordes: and hath a mutual promiſe: namely, the couenant made with Abraham: but promiſes they be, which ſoeuer occurre here &amp; there in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For when God had once made his couenant with the old people, hee ceaſed not now and then to offer his grace by newe promiſes. Whereby it followeth, that the promiſes are referred vnto the couenant, as vnto their onely head: euen as the ſpeciall helpes of God, whereby hee teſtifieth his fauour towardes the faithfull, doe flowe out of the onely fountaine of election. And becauſe the law was nothing els but a renuing of that couenant, which renuing might the better eſtabliſh the remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: it ſeemeth that <hi>law giuing</hi> here in this place ought peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reſtrained vnto iudgements.

For if hee honoured all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, when he coupleth himſelfe to vs by communicating our nature, much more did he honour them, with whom hee woulde haue a neerer bond of coniunction. Although it is alway ſo to bee taken, that if this bleſſing of kinred bee ſeparated from pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is ſo farre from profiting, that rather it turneth to their greater condemnation. Furthermore, here we haue a notable place: that the two natures are ſo diſtinguiſhed in Chriſte,<note place="margin">Two diſtinct natures in Chriſte.</note> that they are vnited together into the perſon of Chriſt. For whereas hee ſaith, Chriſte came of the Iewes, thereby he declareth his true humanitie.

And where he denieth all to be <hi>Iſraelites that are of Iſraell, and all to be ſonnes, that are of the ſeede of Abraham,</hi> it is a kinde of colluſion of wordes (whiche is, when a worde is repeated againe not altogether the ſame, but ſomewhat changed) ſeeing in the firſt member he comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the whole progenie, in the other he noteth only the true ſonnes, namely, which doe not degenerate.</p>

Yet the meaning is, that this diuerſitie, touching the inheritance of the promiſe, may not onely bee ſeene in the ſonnes of Abraham: but alſo there is a farre more euident example thereof in Iacob and Eſau.

But whence that came, he had either not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, or els he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely inſinuated it. But nowe he doth plainely referre the whole cauſe, vnto the election of God, and the ſame free, and ſuch as doth not depend vpon men: that in the ſaluation of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing might be ſought for aboue the goodneſſe of God: and in the deſtruction of the reprobate, nothing aboue his iuſt ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.<note place="margin">The firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> Let this therefore be the firſt propoſition, as the bleſſing of the couenant, doth ſeparate the people of Iſrael from all other nations: ſo alſo the election of God diſcerneth the men of that nation, whiles he predeſtinateth ſome vnto ſaluation, and other

The <hi>2.</hi> propoſition is, that there is no other foundation of that election then the meere goodnes of God, and alſo mercie, ſince the fall of Adam,<note place="margin">The ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> which mercie (not for any conſideration of woorkes at all) imbraceth whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.

But rather whom he will he paſſeth ouer, and whom he will he chooſeth. All theſe thinges doeth Paule compriſe briefly in one ſentence, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he will proſecute the reſt. Finally in theſe wordes, <hi>when they were not yet borne, or had done good or euill,</hi> he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that God in putting of a difference, could not haue reſpect to the woorkes, which were not yet. And they which reaſon to the contrarie, ſaying, that doth not let, but the election of God may diſcerne betweene men, according to their merites, becauſe God doth foreſee by the works to come, who wil be worthy or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his grace: doe not ſee more then the Apoſtle, but fal in that principle of religion, which ought to be very well knowen to all Chriſtians: namely, that God could ſee nothing in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature of man, ſuch as was in Eſau and Iacob, whereby he might be moued to doe good. Therefore when he ſaith, that both of them had then done neither good nor euil, it is alſo to be added which he preſumeth: namely that both of them were the ſonnes of Adam, by nature ſinners, indued with no crumme of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Neither doe I therefore ſtand ſo long in expounding theſe, as though the minde of the Apoſtle were doubtfull: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sophiſters not being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimplicitie therof, goe about by their friuolous diſtinctions to creepe out hence, my meaning was to ſhew, that Paule was not ignoraunt of thoſe thinges they bring: but that they rather are blinde in the firſt principles of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Moreouer, although the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is diſperſed ouer all mankynde, before it come (as they ſay) into action, is auayleable enough vnto condemnation, wherby followeth that Eſau was woorthely reiected, becauſe naturally he was the ſonne of wrath: yet leaſt anye doubt ſhould remayne, as though through reſpect of any fault or ſinne his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was the woorſe, it was neceſſary as well ſinnes as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhould be excluded.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>Surely true it is, that the next cauſe of reprobation, is, for that wee are all accurſed in Adam: yet to the end we might learne to reſt in the bare and ſimple will of God, Paule dyd lead vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from the conſideration thereof, for ſo long, vntill hee had eſtabliſhed this doctrine: namely, that God hath a ſufficient iuſt cauſe of election and reprobation in his owne will or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

Wherfore we haue all the ſtablenes of our election concluded in the onely purpoſe of God: merites are worth nothing here, which ſerue for nothing but vnto death: no dignitie is regarded, for ther is none: but the onely goodnes of God raigneth.

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more this is that kind of vnrighteouſneſſe, which fleſh imagineth, that one being neglected, God doth reſpect another. That Paul might looſe this knot, he deuideth the whole cauſe into two mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers: in the former whereof he intreateth of the elect, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the reprobate: and his will is, that in thoſe, wee conſider the mercy of God, but in theſe we acknowledge the iuſte iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Firſt of all therefore hee aunſwereth, that this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation is execrable, that vnrighteouſnes ſhould bee thought to be with God: then ſecondly he declareth on both ſides, how there can be none. Yet before we goe further, this obiection teſtifieth cleerely, that God hath elected ſome, &amp; reiected otherſome, &amp; the cauſe is no where els to be ſought for, then in his purpoſe. For if the difference were grounded vpon the reſpect of works, in vaine had Paule moued queſtion of the vnrighteouſnes of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there could be no ſuſpition, if he handled euery one according to his deſert.

This might ſeeme to be a cold excuſe, that God is not vniuſt, becauſe he is merciful to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wil: but becauſe vnto God, his owne onely authority is ſufficient, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſtandeth in no need of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, it was ſufficient vnto Paul y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was appointed a defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And ſo hee noteth the higheſt cauſe of beſtowing grace, namely, his voluntary decree: and withall hee inſinuateth, that hee hath appoynted his mercye peculiarly for certaine.

I will doe, what I will doe: And alſo the pronowne Relatiue expreſſeth plainely, that mercy is not indifferently for al. This libertie is taken from God, if his election be tyed to external cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. In tow wordes which <hi>Moſes</hi> vſeth, the onely cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is expreſſed: for <hi>Chanan</hi> is to fauour, or giue a benefit free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; liberally: but <hi>Racham</hi> is to ſhew mercy. So that is brought to paſſe that Paul intendeth: namely, that the mercy of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is free, is not tyed, but he may ſhew it where he luſt.</p>

                  <hi>16 So then it is not &amp;c.)</hi> By that teſtimonie hee gathereth, that without all controuerſie it followeth, the election of God is not to be attributed to our induſtrie, or ſtudie, or indeuour: but is wholy to be referred vnto the counſaile of God. Leaſt any ſhold thinke, that they who are choſen, are therefore choſen becauſe they dyd deſerue it, or had wonne vnto themſelues the fauour of God by any meanes: or finally, becauſe there was in them any crumme of dignitie or worthineſſe, whereby the Lord might be prouoked. And vnderſtand it ſimply, that it ſtandeth not in our wil or ſtudie (for he hath put courſe for ſtudy) that we ſhould be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And they who reaſon out of this place that there is in vs ſome force or vertue of ſtudie, but whiche can doe nothing by it ſelfe, except it be holpen by the mercy of God, they doe it fooliſhly. For the Apoſtle doth not ſhewe what is in vs: but excludeth all our indeuours. It is therefore a meere cauillation that they bring in: namely, that wee will and runne, becauſe Paule denieth it to bee in the willer or runner: ſeeing his minde is nothing els, then that neither will nor running doth any thing. Yet they are againe to bee reproued, who, to the ende they might giue place to the grace of God, abide ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and idle. For although we profite nothing by our owne ſtudy, yet that ſtudie which is inſpired of God is not vneffectual. Theſe thinges are not therefore ſaide, that wee ſhoulde by our waywardneſſe or ſlouthfulneſſe choke the ſpirite of GOD infuſing his ſparkles into vs: but that we ſhould vnderſtand, it is of him, whatſoeuer we haue: and therefore let vs learne both to aſke all things of him, to hope for all thinges, and to aſcribe all things to him, &amp; alſo with feare &amp; trembling to ſeek our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> hath gone about by another ſophiſticall, but a filthie or rotten cauillation, to abuſe the ſentence of Paule: namely, that it is not the willer or runner onely, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God hel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peth. Whom <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath not onely ſoundly, but wittilye refuted: for if the will of man be therefore denied to be the cauſe of election, becauſe it is not the onely cauſe, but in part: then thus it may be ſaide againe, that it is not of mercy but of the willer and runner. For where there is a mutuall woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng there ſhall alſo bee a mutuall praiſe.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, is it like, ſeeing the refutation was readie and eaſie, that Paule, without ſpeeche, woulde ſuffer the Scripture to bee ſo groſſely abuſed?

               <p>Secondly, the ende thereof, which is that the name of God might be celebrated: and to that ende doth Paule chiefly ſtaye vpon it. For if this hardening be ſuch, for the which the name of GOD deſerueth to bee declared, that hee ſhoulde bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with vnrighteouſneſſe, is abhomination. It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the places of contraries. But becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie interpreters, whiles they go about to qualifie this place alſo, they doe corrupt it, firſt it is to bee noted, that for the worde <hi>ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp.</hi> In Hebrewe it is, I haue ordeyned thee: where, the Lorde going about to declare that the ſtubbornneſſe of Pharaoh was no let to him, that hee might not deliuer his people, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that his furie was not onely foreſeene of him, and that hee had meanes prepared to brydle it, but alſo that hee had purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo ordeyned it, and verely to that ende, that hee might ſhewe foorth a more euident teſtimonie of his power. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe turne it amiſſe, namely that Pharaoh was reſerued to a tyme, ſeeing rather hee ſpeaketh of the beginning. For ſeeing many thinges elſe where occurre vnto men, whiche hinder their counſayles, and let the courſe of their actions, God ſaith Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh came from him, and that this perſon was layde vpon him. Vnto which ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word raiſe or ſtirre vp, notably agreeth. Finally, leaſt any ſhould imagin, that Pharaoh was moued from aboue, by a certaine vniuerſall and confuſed motion, that hee might ruſhe into that furie, the ſpeciall cauſe or ende is noted: as if it were ſayde, that God did not onely know what Pharoah woulde do: but alſo purpoſely appointed him to this vſe. Where by it followeth, that it is in vayne nowe to ſtriue with him, as though hee were bounde to giue a reaſon or account, ſeeing hee doeth willingly come forth himſelfe, and preuenteth this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, denouncing, that the reprobate, in whom hee will haue his name celebrated, come from the ſecret fountain of his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p n="18">

<pb facs="tcp:7612:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becauſe ſtraightwayes he addeth a communication with the aduerſary, when he beginneth to bring foorth ſuch things as may be obiected of the contrary part. Therfore it is not to be doubted but Paule ſpeaketh theſe of his owne ſence, as we haue admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a little before, namely, that God according to his pleaſure, voutſafeth whom he ſeeth good of mercy: and draweth foorth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeuerity of iudgement againſt whom he liſt. For this hee goeth about to bring to paſſe amongeſt vs, that concerning the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is betweene the elect and reprobate, our mind might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, namely, that it hath ſo pleaſed God, to illuminate ſome vnto ſaluation, and blind otherſome vnto death: and not ſeeke for any cauſe aboue his will. For we muſt ſtande vpon theſe particles, <hi>of whom hee will, and whom hee will:</hi> Beyond y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he doeth not ſuffer vs to paſſe. But the worde <hi>harden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To harden how it is taken.</note> when in the Scriptures it is attributed to GOD, it doth not onely ſignifie (as certaine tempering moderatours woulde haue it) a permiſſion or ſuffering, but alſo the action of Gods wrath.

And Satan him ſelfe, which inwardly worketh effectually, is ſo farre foorth his miniſter, that he worketh not but at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Therefore that friuolous euaſion or refuge, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchoole men haue of foreknowledge, doth fall downe. For Paule doth not onely ſay, that the ruine of the wicked is foreſeene of the Lorde, but is ordeined by his counſaile and will: as Salomon alſo teacheth,<note place="margin">Prou. 16.4.</note> that the deſtruction of the wicked, was not onely foreknowne, but that the wicked ones themſelues were purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly created, that they might periſh.</p>

Wherefore the Apoſtle deſcendeth agayne vnto obiections, by taking to him the ſpeeche of the aduerſarie: becauſe hee ſawe the mouthes of the wicked coulde not bee ſtopped, but with full mouthes they woulde barke agaynſt the righteouſneſſe of God. And hee doth notably expreſſe their affection. For, they not beeing content to defende themſelues, make God guiltie in their ſteade: and then after they haue turned the fault of their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vpon him, they are grieued at his ſo great power. In deed they are conſtrayned to yeelde, but ſtorming, becauſe they can not reſiſt: and attributing to him the principalitie they doe in a manner charge him of tyrannie, muche like as Sophiſters in their Schooles doe in ſuch ſort babble of his abſolute (as they call it) righteouſnes, as though hee hauing forgotten his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, woulde make a tryall of the might of his lordeſhippe, by mixting all thinges peruerſely.

Therefore both his iudgement ſhall be vniuſt if he condemne vs: and alſo his power which hee abuſeth nowe agaynſt vs is licencious. But what doth Paul anſwere to theſe.</p>

               <p>This verily is apparaunt, that no cauſe is brought aboue the will of God. Seeing the anſwere was at hande, namely, that the difference doeth depende vpon iuſt cauſes: why did not Paule vſe this conpendious or ſhort forme, but placed the will of God in the higheſt degree, that it onely might ſuffice vs for all cauſes? aſſuredly if the obiection had been falſe, that God doeth reiect or elect according to his pleaſure, whom hee eyther vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth not with fauour, or whom hee loueth freely, the refutation had not been neglected of Paule. The wicked obiect, that men are cleared from guiltines, if the will of God beare the chiefeſt ſway in their ſaluation and deſtruction. Doth Paule denie it? Yea by his anſwere hee confirmeth, namely that God doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree or determine of men as it pleaſeth him: yet in vayne and madly doe men riſe vp to contende, becauſe God by his right power, or authoritie aſſigneth to his woorkes what lotte he will. And they who ſay that Paule wanting reaſon, did flee vnto brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or chiding, charge the holy Ghoſt with great reproch. For hee woulde not at the firſt bring forth thoſe thinges which might make to the defence of the equitie of God, and which he had in a readineſſe, becauſe they coulde not be conceiued or apprehended. Yea hee alſo ſo tempereth the ſeconde reaſon, that hee doeth not vndertake a full defence. But yet ſo that hee declareth or ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth forth the righteouſneſſe of God, if it bee with deuout humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and reuerence weighed of vs. That therefore whiche was moſt meete, hee admoniſheth man of his condition, as if hee ſayd, ſeeing thou art a man, thou muſt acknowledge thy ſelfe earth and aſhes: why then doeſt thou contende with the Lord, about a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which thou canſt not vnderſtande? to bee briefe, the Apoſtle hath not brought that coulde bee ſayde, but that was expedient for our rudneſſe. Proude men ſtorme, that Paul, not denying men to be reiected or elected by the ſecrete counſayle of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth no cauſe, as though the ſpirite of God wanting reaſon helde his peace: and not rather by his ſilence did admoniſhe that the myſterie which the mindes of men do not comprehend, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently

to be had in admiration, &amp; ſo might bridle the wayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mans curioſitie. Let vs know therefore that God doeth not for any other end ceaſe from ſpeaking, but becauſe he ſeeth his infinite wiſedome cannot be comprehended by our ſlender capacity, and therfore ſparing our infirmity, prouoketh vs vnto ſobriety and modeſty. <hi>Shall the thing formed.</hi> We ſee that Paul hitherto doth alway ſtand vpon this, namely, that the wil of God, although the reaſon therof is vnknowen to vs, is to bee counted iuſt.

Now if God patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe for ſome time, not deſtroying them at the firſt moment, but differring the iudgement prepared for them, and that to ſhew forth the teſtimonies of his ſeueritie, that others might bee terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſo horrible examples: and alſo to ſet foorth his power, whereunto hee maketh them diuerſly to ſerue: and laſtly that thereby the greatneſſe of his mercie towardes the elect might be better knowen, and more clearely appeare: what is woorthie to be reprehended in this diſpenſation? howe be it it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell though he ſhewe not, whence it is that they are veſſels prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for deſtruction. For out of that is gone before, he taketh it to be a ſure thing, that the cauſe is hid in the eternall, and vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able counſell of God: the righteouſnes wherof we ought rather to worſhip, then to ſearch after. And he hath put veſſels in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſignification for inſtrumentes. For whatſoeuer action there is in any creature, it is (as a man would ſay) the miniſtery of the power of God. Very fitly therefore are wee the faithfull called veſſels of mercie, whiche the Lord doeth vſe as inſtrumentes to ſhewe foorth his mercie: and the reprobate, the veſſelles of wrath, ſeeing they ſerue to ſhewe foorth the iudgementes of God.</p>

For what do theſe differ from thoſe, but that they are deliuered from the ſame goulfe of deſtruction by the Lord? And that by no deſert of their owne, but of his free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Therefore it can not otherwiſe bee, but that infinite goodneſſe of God towardes the elect, ſhoulde bee commended more and more, when wee conſider howe miſerable all they are, who doe not eſcape his wrath.

               <p n="26">
                  <hi>26 Whom he hath alſo called.</hi> Out of that diſputation which hee hath hitherto had of the libertie of Gods election, two
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7612:142"/>
thinges followed: namely that the grace of God is not ſo inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the people of the Iewes, that it can not alſo flowe forth vnto other nations, and ſpread it ſelf ouer the whole world. Secondly that it is not ſo tyed to the Iewes, that it muſt needs come vnto all the ſonnes of Abraham according to the fleſhe, without exception. For if the election of God, be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his pleaſure onely: whither ſo euer his will ſhall turne it ſelf. there alſo the election of God hath place. Election therefore being put downe, nowe the way in a maner is made vnto thoſe thinges which hee hath purpoſed to ſay as well of the calling of the Gentiles, as the reiection of the Iewes: the one whereof, for noualtie did ſeeme abſurde, the other altogether vnmeete or vnworthy. Yet becauſe this latter had more offence in it, hee handleth the other, being leſſe odious, in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>He ſayth therefore that the veſſels of Gods mercie, which he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto the glorie of his name, are taken euery where, no leſſe from among the Gentiles, then the Iewes. But in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>whome,</hi> although the reaſon of grammer bee not obſerued by Paule, yet his meaning is, a paſſage as it were being made, to adde, that wee are thoſe veſſelles of Gods glory, who are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken out from amongſt the Iewes, and partly from amongſt the Gentiles. Where, by an argument taken from the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God hee prooueth, there is no difference of nation in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. For if petigrey taken from the Gentiles, was no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment why God ſhoulde not alſo call vs, it is apparaunt, the Gentiles are not baniſhed from the kingdome of God, and the couenaunt of eternall ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="25">
                  <hi>25 As hee ſayth alſo in Oſee.</hi> Nowe hee declareth that the calling of the Gentiles ought not to ſeeme newe: as which was teſtified long before, by the oracle of the prophete. The ſence is plaine inough, but that there is ſomewhat to doe for applying the teſtimonie: for none will denie, but the Prophete ſpeaketh there of the Iſraelites. For the Lorde being offended at their wickedneſſe, denounceth, they ſhoulde no more afterwarde be his people. After that hee addeth a conſolation: and of not belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, maketh them beloued, of not a people, a people. And Paule goeth about to applie that vnto the Gentiles, which is preciſely ſpoken vnto the Iſraelites.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7612:143"/>They who hitherto haue beſt vnfolded this knot, haue thought that Paule woulde reaſon thus: that which might be ſuppoſed an impediment to the Gentiles, to hinder them from beeing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of ſaluation, was alſo in the people of Iſrael: as God therefore in old time did graciouſly receiue the Iewes into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, whom he had caſt off and baniſhed: euen ſo nowe he vſeth the ſame bountifulnes towardes the Gentiles. But becauſe that interpretation, although it may be ſuffered, yet ſeemeth vnto me to be ſomewhat forced, let the readers conſider, whither this be not more apt, if we doe beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conſolation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was not giuen to the Iewes onely, but alſo to the Gentiles. For it is no new or ſtraunge thing among the Prophetes, after they haue publiſhed the vengeance of God, againſt the Iewes for their iniquities, to turne themſelues vnto the kingdome of Chriſte, which was to bee diſperſed ouer the whole worlde. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they that whithout reaſon. For ſeeing the Iewes by their ſinnes did ſo prouoke the wrath of God, that they deſerued to bee diuorced from him, there remaineth no hope of ſaluation, vnleſſe they turne themſelues vnto Chriſte: by whome the couenant of grace is reſtored, and as it was founded in him, ſo now by his interceſſion it is renued. And aſſuredly ſeeing Chriſte is the onely refuge in deſperate affaires, or ſuche as are paſt all hope: no ſounde conſolation can bee brought vnto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinners, and ſuche as ſee the wrath of God hang ouer them, but by ſetting Chriſte before their eyes. Yea this (as wee haue admoniſhed) is ordinary amongeſt the Prophetes, when they haue humbled the people being pricked with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> threatning of Gods vengeance, to recall them vnto Chriſt, the only ſanctuarie of thoſe haue no other refuge. And where the kingdome of Chriſt is erected, there alſo that heauenly Hieruſalem is rayſed vp, into which the Citizens out of all partes of the worlde are gathered. And that chiefly auayleth in the preſent oracle: for when the Iewes were caſt out of the family of God, by that meanes they were brought into a vulgare or common eſtate, and were made like vnto the Gentiles. After the difference is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, nowe the mercie of God hath place indifferently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all nations.</p>
               <p>Whereby wee gather that the teſtimonie of the Prophete is fitly applyed vnto the preſent cauſe. Wherein, God, after
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7612:143"/>
hee hath matched the Iewes with the Gentiles, pronounceth that hee will gather a Church of them both, that they whiche were no people might beginne to bee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will call them my people which is not my people.</hi> This is ſayde in reſpecte of the diuourcement, whiche GOD had nowe made with the people, depriuing them of all dignitie, that they ſhoulde not excell the forraine nations. And althoughe they whome God hath ordayned for ſonnes vnto himſelfe, in his eternall counſell, theſe are, and are for euer, ſonnes: yet the ſcripture many times reckoneth not among the ſonnes of God, but whoſe election is confirmed by calling, Whereby alſo hee teacheth vs not to iudge, and muche leſſe to denounce of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD,<note place="margin">Howe farre was may denounce of the election of God.</note> but ſo farre foorth as it manifeſteth it ſelfe by his tokens. So likewiſe after that Paule had ſhewed vnto the Epheſians, that their election and adoption was determined with God before the creation of the worlde, a little after, he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth they were ſometime ſtraungers from GOD: Namely, according to that time, wherein the Lorde had not yet declared his loue towardes them: although hee had imbraced them with eternall mercie. Therefore in this place they are called, <hi>not beloued,</hi> to whome the Lorde rather teſtifieth his wrath then loue. Finally, vntill adoption reconcile men vnto God, we know his wrath lyeth vpon all mankinde: the <hi>feminine gender</hi> of the participle, dependeth vpon the texte of the Prophete. For hee had ſayde that a daughter was borne vnto him, whome hee called <hi>not beloued:</hi> that vnder this type, the people might knowe they were hated of God. Nowe as reiection was the cauſe of hatred, ſo the Prophete teacheth that the beginning of loue is, when God doth adopt them, who for a tyme were forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="27">
                  <hi>27 And Eſay cryeth.</hi> Nowe he commeth vnto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde part, whereat he woulde not begin leaſte hee ſhoulde exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate their mindes too much. And this is not without ſkill, that he bringeth in the prophet Eſai <hi>crying,</hi> and not ſpeaking: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he might make them more attentiue.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the woordes of the Prophete are plaine, to feare the Iewes, leaſt they ſhould glory too much in the fleſh. For it is horrible to be hearde, that of ſuche an infinite multitude,
<pb facs="tcp:7612:144"/>
a ſmall number onely ſhould be ſaued. For although the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet after he hath deſcribed the deſtruction of the people, leaſt the faithfull ſhoulde thinke the couenaunt of God were vtterly wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out, putteth them in minde there is ſome hope of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning: yet he reſtrayneth that vnto a fewe. But becauſe the Prophet prophecied that of his time, we are to ſee how Paul do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rightly apply it to his purpoſe. And thus it ought to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Lorde woulde deliuer his people out of the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Babylon: hee woulde the benefite of his deliueraunce ſhoulde come vnto a very few of ſo great a multitude: whiche might iuſtly be called the remnant of that deſtruction, in reſpect of the multitude of people, which he ſuffered to periſh in exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nowe that ſame carnall reſtitution, did figure the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the Church of God, which is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed in Chriſt: Yea, it was onely the beginning thereof. That therefore which happened then, muſt needes more certainly be fulfilled nowe in the progreſſe and perfection of the deliuerance.</p>

                  <hi>25 For hee making his account ſhort.</hi> The diuerſitie of interpretations being omitted, this ſeemeth vnto me the natural ſenſe, the Lord will both ſo ſhorten, and cut off his people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which ſhall remaine may ſeeme (as it were) a certaine conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, the forme or print of a wonderfull great ruine.

But they doe leudly, and inuerte order, who goe about to ſette and erecte theſe cauſes aboue the ſecrete predeſtination of God, which hee taught before to bee taken for the firſt or higheſt cauſe. Howebeit as that is aboue all cauſes: ſo the corruption and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the vngodly doeth giue place and matter to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God.

               <p>For as it is alreadie declared, hee calleth not the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ceremonies the woorkes of the Lawe: but the merites of workes: vnto the which faith is oppoſed, which faith not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his owne worthynes, doth (that I may ſay ſo) with both eyes beholde the ſole mercie of God. <hi>For they haue ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone.</hi> By an excellent reaſon hee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the former ſentence. For nothing is more abſurde, then that they ſhoulde obtayne righteouſneſſe, whiche goe about to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe it. Chriſt is giuen vnto vs for righteouſneſſe: hee laboureth to depriue him of his office, who ſo thruſteth vpon GOD the righteouſnes of woorkes. And hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſo often as men reſt vpon the confidence of woorkes, vnder the vayne pretence of being zealous for righteouſnes, by furious folly they fight with GOD.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is no harde matter to bee knowen, howe they ſtumble at Chriſt, who truſt to the confidence of woorkes: for except wee acknowledge our ſelues to bee ſinners,<note place="margin">Howe iuſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſtumble at Chriſt.</note> bare and voyde of righteouſnes that is our owne, wee obſcure the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Chriſt: whiche conſiſteth in this, that hee might bee light, health, life, reſurrection, righteouſneſſe, and medicine to vs all. And to what ende ſerue all theſe, but that hee might lighten the blinde, reſtore the damned, quicken the dead, reare them vp are brought to nothing, waſhe them are full of filth, cure and heale thoſe are deadly diſeaſed? yea if we clayme vnto our ſelues any righteouſnes, wee doe in a ſort ſtriue with the power of Chriſt: ſeeing his office is, as well to beate downe all pride of fleſhe, as to eaſe and comfort thoſe labour and are heauie laden. And the teſtimonie is properly cited. For there God denounceth that he will be an offence to the people of Iuda and Iſrael, where at they ſhoulde ſtumble and fall.</p>

By this reaſon the Apoſtle meeteth with an obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might bee moued againſt him. For the Iewes might ſeeme to haue kept the right way, becauſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed or gaue themſelues to the righteouſneſſe of the lawe: It ſtoode him in hande to refute this falſe opinion, whiche thing hee doth heere. For hee ſheweth that hee is a prepoſterous interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the lawe, who ſeeketh to bee iuſtified by the works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: becauſe the law was giuen to this end, that it might lead vs by the hand to another righteouſneſſe. Yea, whatſoeuer the lawe teacheth, whatſoeuer it commandeth, whatſoeuer it promiſeth, it hath Chriſte alway for his marke: ſo then all the partes thereof are to bee directed vnto him.

For albeit the lawe of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe doth promiſe a rewarde to his obſeruers: yet after it hath brought all vnder giltineſſe, it ſubſtituteth a new righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſte, which is not gotten by the merite of woorkes, but, beeing freely giuen, is receiued by faith. So the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith (as wee ſawe in the firſt Chapter) hath teſtimonie of the lawe.

                  <hi>6 For Moſes deſcribeth &amp;c.</hi> That it might appeare how greatly the righteouſneſſe of faith, and the rigteouſnes of works are contrary one to the other, he compareth them together. For by compariſon, the repugnancie which is betweene thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appeareth better. And hee dealeth,<note place="margin">Why paul ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alleageth the teſtimony of Moſes then the Prophetes.</note> not with the oracles of the Prophetes, but with the teſtimonie of Moſes, for this onely cauſe, that the Iewes might vnderſtand, there was not a law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Moſes, which ſhould hold them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confidence of works: but which ſhould rather lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Chriſt.

               <p>Furthermore, whereas Paule maketh the lawe conſent with faith, and yet oppoſeth the righteouſneſſe of that,<note place="margin">The law hath a twofold acception.</note> againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of this, the reaſon thereof muſt be knowen. The lawe hath a twofolde acception. For ſometime it ſignifieth all that doctrine was deliuered by Moſes, ſometimes but that part which was proper to his miniſterie: namely, which is conteined in precepts, rewardes, and puniſhments. For Moſes generally
<pb facs="tcp:7612:149"/>
had this office, that he might inſtruct the people in the true rule of godlineſſe. Which thing if it be true, it behoued him to preach repentance and faith: but faith is not taught, vnleſſe the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Gods mercy, and the ſame free promiſes be propounded or ſet before the people: therefore it behoued him to bee a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the goſpell: which thing hee did faithfully as appeareth by diuers places. And to the ende he might informe the people vnto repentance, it was his part to teach what maner of life were acceptable to God: &amp; that he hath compriſed in the precepts of the lawe. Now to the ende hee might put into the mindes of the people a loue of righteouſnes, and againe, inſerte a hatred of ſinne, promiſes and threatnings were to bee added: whiche might declare, how there are rewardes laid vp for the iuſt, and horrible puniſhments for the wicked. Now alſo it was the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the people to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider by how many wayes they were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and howe farre they were from that, that they could merite God by their workes: ſo they being in diſpaire of their owne righteouſnes might flee vnto the hauen of Gods goodneſſe, and that is vnto Chriſte himſelfe. This was the ende of Moſes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie.</p>
               <p>And now becauſe the promiſes of the goſpell are onely read heere and there in Moſes, and the ſame alſo verie obſcurely: but the precepts and rewardes appointed for the keepers of the lawe appeare eftſoones: worthily is this office properly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly giuen vnto Moſes, to teach what true righteouſnes of workes is: ſecondarily, to ſhewe what reward remaineth for the obſeruation, and what puniſhment for the tranſgreſſion thereof. In this reſpect Moſes himſelfe is compared with Chriſte in Iohn: where it is ſaide, The lawe was giuen by Moſes, grace and truth is fulfilled by Chriſte. And ſo often as the lawe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo ſtricktly,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.17.</note> Moſes is couertly oppoſed vnto Chriſte: and therefore wee are then to conſider what the lawe conteineth in it ſelfe, beyng ſeparate from the goſpell. That therfore which is ſaide heere of the righteouſneſſe of the lawe, muſt be referred not vnto the whole office of Moſes, but vnto this part, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly in a maner was committed vnto him.</p>
               <p>Nowe I come vnto the wordes, <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth.</hi>

And Paule rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth thus from that place, ſeeyng no man can obteyne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe preſcribed in the lawe, but he that fulfilleth exactly euery part thereof: and all men haue alway beene farre from that perfection: in vayne doth any ſeeke for ſaluation this way.

For both it ſeemeth to bee improperly wreſted of Paule, and alſo the wordes ſeeme to be chaunged into another ſence. But concerning the words we ſhall ſee what is to be ſaid of them: Firſt let vs conſider the application. For it is a place of Deuteronomie, where (as in the former place) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpeaketh of the doctrine of the lawe:<note place="margin">Deut. 30.12.</note> and Paule draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it vnto the promiſes of the Goſpell. This knotte maye bee well vntied, thus, Moſes in that place ſheweth the facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye or eaſineſſe of comminge vnto life, becauſe the wil of God was not nowe hidde nor ſette a farre off from the Iewes,
<pb facs="tcp:7612:150"/>
but was layd before their eyes. If he ſpake of the law onely, it had beene a friuolous argument: ſeeing the law of God, being put before our eyes, is nothing more eaſie to be done, then if it were ſet a farre off. Therefore he noteth not the lawe onely, but in generall all the doctrine of God, which comprehendeth vnder it the Goſpell. For the worde of the law by it ſelfe, is neuer in our heart: no not the leaſt ſillable thereof, vntil it be put in, by the faith of the Goſpel. Secondly, yea euen after regeneration, the worde of the lawe ſhall not properly bee ſaide to be in our heart: becauſe it requireth perfection, from the which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full themſelues are farre off. But the worde of the Goſpel hath his ſeate in the heart, although it filleth not the heart: for it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth pardon for the imperfection and want. And Moſes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in that Chapter (as alſo in the fourth) ſtudieth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende vnto the people the ſinguler loue of God, becauſe he had receiued them into his tuition and gouernment: whiche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation could not be taken from the bare lawe. Neither let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, that Moſes preacheth there of reforming the life vnto the rule of the lawe: for the ſpirit of regeneration is coupled with the righteouſneſſe of faith. Therefore he collecteth the one out of the other: becauſe the obſeruation of the lawe, is of the faith of Chriſt. Neither is it to be doubted but this ſentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that principle, the Lord ſhal circumciſe thine heart: which he had put downe a little before in the ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p>Wherefore they are eaſily refuted, who ſay that Moſes intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth there of good workes.

If any alleadge, that this interpretation is too muche wreſted, and too ſubtile, let him know the minde of the Apoſtle was not, curiouſly or exactly to handle the place of Moſes: but onely to apply it vnto the treatiſe of the preſent cauſe.

               <p>Wherefore if you take theſe to be ſpoken by the way of amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or poliſhing, thou canſt not ſay that Paule hath violently and vnaptly wreſted the woodes of Moſes: but rather thou wilt confeſſe that without any damage to the ſenſe, hee hath notably alluded vnto the wordes, <hi>heauen</hi> and <hi>Sea.</hi> Now let vs expound the wordes of Paule ſimply. Becauſe the aſſurance of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation dependeth vpon two principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, whiles wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that life is purchaſed for vs, and death conquered to vs. With both which, he teacheth our faith is ſupported by the word of the Goſpell. For Chriſte by dying hath ſwallowed vp death: by ryſing againe he hath gotten life in his power.</p>
               <p>Nowe in the goſpell the benefite of Chriſtes death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is communicated vnto vs; then there is no cauſe that wee ſhoulde ſeeke further for any thing. Therefore that it myght appeare the righteouſneſſe of faith is aboundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vnto ſaluation, hee teacheth that thoſe two members, which onely are neceſſary vnto ſaluation, are conteined in it. <hi>Who then ſhall aſcend into heauen?</hi> Is as much as if he ſaid, who knoweth whether that inheritance of eternall and celeſtiall life abideth for vs? <hi>Who ſhall deſcend into the deepe?</hi> As if thou ſaid, who knoweth whether eternall death of the ſoule alſo follow the death of the bodie? Both which doubtes hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to bee taken away by the righteouſneſſe of faith: For the one ſhould bring Chriſt downe from heauen,<note place="margin">Chriſt in his hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane nature hath taken poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens for the faithfull.</note> the other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death ſhould bring him backe againe. For the aſcention of Chriſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, ought ſo to eſtabliſh our faith of eternall life, that hee in a maner draweth Chriſte himſelfe out of the poſſeſſion of the heauens, that doubteth whether the inheritance of heauen, bee prepared for the faithfull, in whoſe name and cauſe hee is entred in thyther. Likewiſe, ſeeing hee tooke vpon hym the great horrours of Hell, that hee myghte deliuer vs thence, to call it into queſtion, whether the faythfull
<pb facs="tcp:7612:151"/>
be ſtill ſubiect to this miſerie, is to make his death voide, and in a maner to denie it.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <hi>8 But what ſaith it.</hi> That negatiue ſpeech which the Apoſtle hath hitherto vſed, did ſerue to take away the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of faith: it remaineth therefore that he declare the maner of obteining righteouſneſſe, vnto the which ende this affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is added. And whereas there is an interrogation interpoſed, when they might all haue beene ſpoken together in on courſe of ſpeeche, that is done to procure attention. And alſo his meaning is to ſhewe, what a great difference there is betweene the righteouſnes of the law and the Goſpel: ſeeing that ſheweth it ſelfe a farre off, it doth driue away all men from comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: but this offering it ſelfe at hand, doth familiarly inuite vs vnto the fruition of it. <hi>The word is neere thee.</hi> Firſt of all this is to bee noted, that leaſt the mindes of men beeing carried away by vaine circumſtances, ſhoulde erre from ſaluation, the boundes of the worde are preſcribed vnto them, within the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they ought to keepe themſelues, For it is as if hee ſhoulde commaund them to bee contente with the worde onely, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them that in this glaſſe the ſecretes of heauen are to bee ſeene, which would both daſill theyr eyes with their brightnes, &amp; aſtoniſhe their eares, and alſo make the mynd it ſelf amaſed. Therefore the godly receiue an excellent conſolation out of this place, touchyng the certaynetie of the worde: namely, that they may as ſafely reſt therein, as in the moſt preſent beholdyng of things, or as in any thyng is preſent and in hande. Secondly it is to bee noted, that ſuche a worde is propounded by Moſes, wherein wee haue firme and ſure truſt of ſaluation. <hi>This is the worde of faith.</hi> Iuſtly doth Paule take that: for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the lawe, doth not pacyfie and quiet the conſcience: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth it miniſter vnto the conſcience thoſe thinges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it ought to bee content. Yet in the meane whyle hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not the other partes of the worde, no not the precepts of the lawe: but his mynde is to put downe remiſſion of ſinnes for righteouſneſſe, and that without ſuche exact obedyence as the lawe requireth. Therefore the worde of the goſpell, wherein wee are not commaunded to merite righteouſneſſe by workes, but to imbrace it by faith, being freely offered, ſufficeth to pacifie
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7612:151"/>
mens conſciences and eſtabliſh their ſaluation. And the worde of faith by the figure <hi>Metonymia,</hi> is put for the worde of promiſe, that is for the goſpel: becauſe it hath a relation with faith. For the contrarietie whereby the law is diſcerned from the goſpell muſte bee vnderſtood. And out of this note of diſtinction we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the lawe requireth workes, ſo the goſpell requireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but that men bring faith to receiue the grace of God. This parcell <hi>whiche wee preache,</hi> is therefore added, leaſt any ſhoulde ſuſpect Paule to diſſent from Moſes. For hee teſtifieth that in the miniſterie of the Goſpell hee agreeth with Moſes: ſeeing he alſo did not place our felicitie any other where then in the free promiſe of Gods grace.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <hi>9 So that if thou confeſſe.</hi> This alſo is rather an alluſion then a proper and naturall interpretation. For it is like that Moſes by the figure <hi>Synecdoche</hi> did vſe the worde <hi>mouth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> is when by one thing another is vnderſtood.</note> for face or countenance. But it was not vnſeemely for the Apoſtle to allude vnto the worde <hi>mouth</hi> to this ſenſe, when the Lorde publiſheth his worde before our face aſſuredly hee calleth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the confeſſion thereof. For whereſoeuer the woorde of the Lorde is there it ought to fructifie: and the fruite, is the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mouth. Whereas hee putteth confeſſion before faith, it is the figure <hi>Anaſtrophe,</hi> very vſuall in the Scriptures. For the order had beene better,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anaſtrophe,</hi> is an inuerſion of wordes when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is firſt ſhould be laſt, &amp;c.</note> if faith of the hearte being put in the firſt place, confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mouth which proceedeth thence, had beene added. And he doth confeſſe the Lorde Ieſus aright who adorneth him with his vertue, acknowledging him to bee ſuch one, as hee is giuen of the father, and deſcribed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
               <p>And whereas reſurrection onely is named, wee muſt not ſo take it, as though his death were in no place: but becauſe Chriſt by ryſing again made vp our ſaluation. For albeit our redemption and ſatiſfaction was accompliſhed by his death, by the which we are reconciled vnto God: yet the victorie againſt ſinne, death, and Satan, was gotten by his reſurrection. Hence alſo came righteouſneſſe, newnes of life, and the hope of bleſſed immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And therefore oftentimes reſurrection only is ſet before vs for our confidence of ſaluation, not that it ſhoulde lead vs away from his death, but becauſe it teſtifieth the effecte
<pb facs="tcp:7612:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and fruite of his death: to bee briefe, his reſurrection conteineth in it his death. Whereof we haue ſaid ſomewhat in the vi. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And alſo that Paule requireth not onely an hiſtoricall fayth, but hee compriſeth the ende thereof in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For wee muſt remember wherefore Chriſte roſe againe: namely, that in rayſing him, the counſaile or aduiſe of God the father was, to reſtore vs all to life. For although Chriſte had this power of himſelfe to take his ſoule againe, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>10 For with the hearte man beleeueth vnto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> This place may further vs to the vnderſtanding of the iuſtification of faith. For it declareth that wee are thereby iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, that we imbrace the mercy of God offered vnto vs in the Goſpell: hence therefore is it, that wee are iuſte, becauſe wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God is gracious vnto vs in Chriſte. But let vs note, that the ſeate of faith is not in the head but in the hearte: and yet I will not contend about that matter, in what part of the body faith reſteth: but becauſe the worde <hi>hearte,</hi> is almoſt alway ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a ſerious and ſincere affection,<note place="margin">What faith is.</note> I ſay faith is a firme &amp; effectuall confidence, and not a bare knowledge onely. <hi>With his mouth man maketh confeſſion vnto ſaluation.</hi> It may ſeeme marueilous, why hee ſhould now attribute a portion of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing ſo often before this teſtified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that wee are ſaued by faith onely. But thereby it may not bee collected, that confeſſion is the cauſe of our ſaluation: onely his minde is to ſhew, how God doth perfect our ſaluation: namely, whiles he cauſeth faith w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee hath put into our harts, to appeare forth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And ſurely, hee that is iuſtified, euen nowe alreadie hath obteined ſaluation: therefore the faith of the hearte maketh no leſſe vnto ſaluation, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the mouth.

Gradation, conſider firſt,<note place="margin">Gradation is when the ſpeecht is ſo diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by degrees that that which endeth one mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber beginneth the next.</note> that there was a mutuall coniunction betwixt the calling of the Gentiles and the miniſterie of Paul, which hee did performe and execute among them: ſo that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the one did depende vpon the approbation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now it behoued Paul to make the calling of the Gentiles manifeſt and without all doubt or queſtion, and alſo to ſhewe a reaſon of his miniſterie, leaſt that he ſhould ſeeme to publiſhe the grace of God amiſſe, in that hee did withdrawe or take from the children of God, the bread which was properly appointed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and giue it to dogs. And therefore he doth both theſe thinges to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But the coherencie &amp; agreement of his wordes will not de perfectly vnderſtood, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery particular part therof be expounded in order. This his proceeding is as much in effect, as if hee ſhould ſay, that both Iewes and Gentiles declare and ſhew that they beleeue in God, by calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his name: becauſe the true calling vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of god ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be, except there were firſt a right knowledge of him. Furthermore, faith commeth by the word of God. But the worde of God is preached in no place but by the ſpeciall prouidence and appointment of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God is, there is alſo faith: where faith is, there was alſo firſt the ſeed of the word, Where preaching is, there is alſo the calling of God, or there men are called of God. Now where there is ſo effectuall and fruitfull a calling of God: there is an euident and vnfallible toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god his loue. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Gentiles are not to be debarred or excluded the kingdome of God, whom God hath admitted into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip &amp; participation of ſaluation. For as the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel is the cauſe of their faith, ſo God his ſending is the cauſe of preaching, whereby it pleaſed him to prouide for their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after this maner. Now let vs examine particularly, that which followeth.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <hi>14 How ſhall they call, &amp;c.</hi> Paules mind is to ioyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God with faith, as indeed they are things neerely linked and ioyned together: for hee who calleth vpon God doth (as it were) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit himſelf into the only hauen of ſaftie:<note place="margin">To flee vnto God in prayers is the ſafeſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of all.</note> and that which is the moſt ſureſt kind of refuge, hee doeth like a ſonne repoſe or lay himſelfe as it were in the boſome of a moſt good and louing father, that by his care hee may be protected, by his indulgencie
<pb facs="tcp:7612:154"/>
and loue he may bee cheriſhed, by his bountie he may be relieued by his vertue hee may be ſtaied and vpholden. Which thing no man can doe, who before hath not ſo certaine a perſuaſion of god his fatherly loue toward him ſetled in his minde: that hee dare boldly hope or looke for any thing at his handes.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is neceſſarie that he who calleth vpon God ſhould aſſure himſelfe to receiue aide and helpe from him. For Paule ſpeaketh heere of that Inuocation which pleaſeth God. For hypocrites call vpon God, but not to their ſaluation, becauſe they call vpon him without any ſenſe or feeling of faith. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euident how fooliſh all the Schoole men bee, who offer themſelues doubtfully to God, not being ſtaied by faith. Paul is of a quite contrary minde, who taketh this as a principle graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: namely, that we cannot pray aright vnleſſe we be certainely perſwaded of the ſucceſſe. Neither doth he ſet downe here an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate or doubtfull faith, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaintie or aſſurance which our mindes conceaue of his fatherly loue and goodnes, whiles by the Goſpel he reconcileth vs to himſelf &amp; adopteth vs for his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. By this confidence only we haue acceſſe to him: as it is alſo to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ephe.<note place="margin">Epheſi. 3.12.</note> And on the other ſide gather y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> that only is true faith, which of if ſelf bringeth forth the inuocation of god. For it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be, but that he ſhould continually aſpire vnto the goodnes of God, by all prayers or ſupplications, who once hath taſted of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhall they beleeue in him of whom &amp;c.</hi> The ſumme &amp; ſenſe of theſe wordes is this: namely, that wee are after a ſorte dumbe vntil the promiſe of God open our mouth to pray. Which order alſo he noteth in the prophet Zach. in theſe wordes: I will ſay to them,<note place="margin">Zacha. 13.9.</note> you are my people, and they ſhall ſay to me, thou art our god. For it is not our parts to feigne and imagine what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of God we liſt. Therefore we muſt haue the true &amp; lawefull knowledge of him, ſuch as is ſet downe in his word. And if any man ſhall ſuppoſe God to be good by his owne ſenſe &amp; imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">God muſt be known and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped according to his woorde</note> that ſhall be no ſure and ſtable faith, but a wauering and wandering imagination. And therfore the word is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the true knowledge of God. Here he hath ſet down no other word then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is preached, becauſe this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinarie meanes which the Lord hath appointed for the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7612:154"/>
But if any man ſhall heereby contende to proue that God could not otherwiſe then by the meanes of preaching, infuſe, or power his knowledge into men, we denie that to be the meaning of the Apoſtle, who had reſpect onely to the ordinarie diſpenſation of God, and woulde not preſcribe any lawe or limitation to his grace.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <hi>15 Howe ſhall they preach except they bee ſent?</hi> Hee meaneth that it is an argument and pledge of the loue of God, when hee doeth vouchſafe any nation with the preaching of his Goſpell, and that there is no preacher thereof, whome hee hath not ſtirred vp by his ſpeciall prouidence: and therefore there is no queſtion, but God doth viſite that nation, where his goſpel is preached. But becauſe Paul doth not here handle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of euery man to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> function, it ſhould be needles to vſe any long ſpech therof in this place.

               <p>For where as the Hebrewe woorde <hi>ſhemugnah</hi> ſignifieth ſpeech paſſiuely, the Grecians haue expounded it <hi>acoen</hi> and the Latines <hi>ſermonem,</hi> albeit improperly, yet not in any obſcure or doubtfull ſence.

               <p>Secondly, that he hath powred out his bleſſinge by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Goſpel, that he might lighten the mindes of men by fayth, and by the ſame fayth alſo might prepare them to call vpon his name, wherein ſaluation is promiſed to all.

And this a worthie and excellent place concerning the vertue and efficatie of preaching, becauſe he doeth teſtifie that fayth proceedeth and ſpringeth from it.

               <p>Furthermore wee muſt note, that fayth is not grounded vpon any other doctrine then vpon the worde of God: for Paule doth not ſay that fayth doeth proceede from euery doctrine,<note place="margin">Fayth is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the word of God onely.</note> but hee reſtrayneth it by expreſſe wordes to the worde of God: which reſtraynte were abſurde, if faith might leane or ſtay itſelfe vpon the decrees of men.

For in that Paule turned to the Gentiles vpon the ſudden, there was no ſmall offence taken at this his ſudden change and alteration. Therefore hee aſketh this queſtion, whether God had neuer directed and ſent his voice before to the Gentiles, and performed the duetie of a teacher to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the whole world.</p>

Therefore I take this his allegation in the proper &amp; naturall ſence or meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſo that the argument may be this, namely, that God hath made his dietie manifeſt to the Gentiles euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, albeit not by the preaching of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his creatures.

It appeareth therefore, that God, euen at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time wherin he contayned &amp; kept the grace of his couenant with in the people of Iſrael, did not withdraw his knowledge in ſuch ſort from the Gentiles, but that hee did alway ſhewe them ſome ſparke, and light thereof.

                  <hi>19 But I demaunde, hath not Iſrael knowne &amp;c.</hi> This obiection of the contrary part, is taken from the compariſon of the leſſer and greater. Paul hath reaſoned that the Gentiles are not to be debarred and excluded from the knowledge of God, ſeeing that God from the beginning, albeit obſcurely and by ſhadowes, hath manifeſted himſelfe vnto them, or at the leaſt hath giuen them ſome taſte of his trueth. What then ſhall wee ſay of Iſraell, who was lightened with a farre other light of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? For howe commeth it to paſſe, that prophane men, and ſuch as were ſtrangers, ſhoulde runne to the light beeing ſhewed them a farre off, but the holy ſtocke of Abraham ſhoulde refuſe the light being familiarly and playnely ſeene.</p>
               <p>For wee muſt alway reteyne that diſtinction: what nation is ſo renowned or famous, that it hath their Gods approching ſo neere vnto them,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.8.</note> as thy God at this day commeth neere to thee?</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not from the purpoſe, and impertinent to the matter to aſke this queſtion, why the knowledge (of God), did not conſequently enſue and followe the doctrine of the lawe with which Iſrael was indewed. <hi>Firſt Moſes ſaith &amp;c.</hi> By the teſtimonie of Moſes hee prooueth that if God ſhoulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Gentiles before the Iewes, yet there were no abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therein. The place is taken out of that famous Canticle in Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">Deut. 32..21</note> where God vpbrayding the Iewes with their vnfaythfulneſſe, doeth denounce and threaten this vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them, namely, that hee will prouoke them to emulation by taking the Gentiles into his couenant: becauſe that they were reuolted and fallen away to falſe gods. You haue (ſayth hee) diſpiſed &amp; reiected mee, &amp; tranſferred &amp; giuen my right &amp; honor to Idols: and I, to be reuenged of this iniurie, in like maner will bring the Gentiles into your place, and will tranſlate that vnto them which hitherto I haue giuen vnto you. And that coulde not bee done without the denouncing of the Iewes. For heere vpon ſprang the emulation, of which Moſes maketh mention, that God did appoint or take to him ſelfe a nation whiche were no natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; did raiſe vp a new people of nothing, who ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the Iewes were caſt &amp; remoued, euen as they, the true God being forſaken, did giue ouer them ſelues to Idols.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:7612:157"/>And although at the comming of Chriſt they were not fallen to that groſſe and exernall Idolatrie, it maketh nothing for their excuſe: ſeeing they had prophaned the whole worſhip of God by their inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: yea at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt they denied God the father reueyled vnto them in his onely begotten ſonne Chriſt, which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and extreameſt kinde of impietie. Marke that theſe words, a fooliſhe nation, and no nation are the ſame in effect: becauſe without the hope of eternall life there is no eſſence or being of man properly.</p>
               <p>Finally, the beginning and originall of life proceedeth from the light of fayth. Therefore the ſpirituall eſſence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceedeth from newe creation: in whiche ſence Paule cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the faythfull, the worke of God, by the which they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by his ſpirite, and reformed to his owne image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

And that which Paule by inſerting or interpoſing of a fewe wordes, hath ſeperated in this place, is to be founde ioyntly together in the Prophete Eſai:<note place="margin">Eſai. 65.12.</note> where the Lorde denounceth that the time ſhall come wherein hee will tranſlate his grace to the Gentiles: and preſently hee addeth the reaſon, namely, that he was wearie of the contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and rebellion of Iſrael, which now by ouer long continuance was become vntollerable to him.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore hee ſpeaketh, They who enquired not of mee before, and neglected my name, nowe haue ſought after me: (he vſeth the preter perfectence for the future, to ſet downe and note the certainetie of the propheſie) they who ſought not after mee haue founde aboue their hope and deſire.

repent and returne from their defection or falling away (from God.) But there is nothing more euident, then that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth ſpeake of ſtrangers, becauſe it followeth by and by in the text: I ſayd, <hi>Beholde I am come to a people, who haue not called vpon my name.</hi> Therefore without queſtion the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth pronounce, that it ſhall come to paſſe, that thoſe ſhould be receiued into the houſhold of God, by a new adoption, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime were ſtrangers. That is therefore the calling of the Gentiles, in which notwithſtanding the generall type &amp; figure of the calling of all the faithfull doth appeare. For there is no man who preuenteth the Lorde, but we are all without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottomles pit of death, by his free mercie: where there is no knowledge of him, no deſire of worſhipping him, to conclude, no ſence or feeling of his truth.</p>

                  <hi>Demande then. &amp;c.</hi> That which he hath hitherto ſaid of the cecitie &amp; obſtinacie of the Iewes, might ſeeme to tend vnto this, as though Chriſt by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming had tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the promiſes els where, the Iewes beeing put out from all hope of ſaluation. Therefore he preuenteth that obiection in this place: and ſo moderateth that hee had ſaid before of the reiection of the Iewes, that no man ſhould thinke the couenant which GOD made in old time with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, was nowe abrogated: or that God had ſo forgotten it, that the Iewes now ſhould be vtterly eſtranged from his kingdome, as the Gentiles were before the comming of Chriſt. Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that, and will ſurely ſtraightwayes ſhewe it to bee falſe. Neither is this the queſtion, whether God hath rightly, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly reiected his people. For in the former Chapter it hath been proued, that when the people through a prepoſterous zeale did reiect the righteouſnes of God, being iuſtly puniſhed for their pride, they were worthily blinded, and at length cut off from the couenant. So that now the cauſe of their reiection is not in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: but the queſtion is of another matter, namely, although they haue deſerued ſuch vengeance of God, whether yet the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made in old time with the fathers, be aboliſhed, which couenant, that it ſhould through anie infidelitie of men be ouerthrown, were abſurd. For Paul reteineth this principle, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adoption of God is free, &amp; is founded vppon God only, &amp; not vppon men, it doeth ſtand firme, what incredulitie ſoeuer of men conſpire to ouerthrow it: this knot muſt be looſed, leaſt the truth and election of God ſhould be thought to depende vpon the dignitie of men. <hi>For I my ſelfe am an Iſraelite.</hi> Before hee enter into the cauſe, by the way hee prooueth in his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, howe abſurde it is to thinke that nation is vtterly forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of GOD. For he was an Iſraelite from the firſte begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not a proſelite,<note place="margin">The nation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes is not vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly caſt off.</note> or newly receiued into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of Iſrael. And ſeeing hee was woorthely counted amongeſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7612:160"/>
the ſpeciall ſeruantes of God, it is an argument that the grace of God did reſt in Iſrael. He therfore taketh the concluſion as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which yet he wil afterward open by a neceſſarie diſcourſe. Whereas beſides the title of an Iſraelite, hee calleth himſelfe the ſeede of Abraham, and alſo expreſſeth his tribe, it is to the ende, hee might be counted for a naturall Iſraelite.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.4.</note> As to the Philippians: whereas ſome thinke it to ſerue vnto the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the mercy of God, that Paul came of the tribe of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin, which was almoſt cut off, that ſeemeth to bee forced and farre fetched.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2 God hath not.</hi> It is a negatiue anſweare, and with a moderation. For the Apoſtle, in denying preciſely the people to be reiected, had byn contrary to himſelf. But by adding a correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he teacheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſuch a kind of reiection, as the promiſe of God is not thereby made voyde. So the aunſweare is diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into two parts, namely, that God hath not, contrarie to the faith of his couenaunt, reiected the whole progenie of Abraham: neither yet is the effect of the adoption extant in all the ſonnes of the fleſh, becauſe the ſecret eleccion goeth before. So the general reiection could not make, but ſome ſeede might be ſaued: for the viſible bodie of the people was ſo reiected, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no member ſhould fall awaye from the ſpirituall bodie of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> If anye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, whither circumciſion were not a common pledge of the grace of God to all the Iewes, ſo that they ought all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be counted amongſt the people of God: the anſwere is at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, becauſe the externall calling by it ſelfe, is vneffectuall without faith, that honour is iuſtly taken from the faithleſſe,<note place="margin">Anſweare.</note> which they refuſe being offered. So there remayneth a ſpeciall people, in whom God ſheweth a teſtimonie of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy: and Paul brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the original of conſtancie, from the ſecret electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For here God is not ſaide to reſpect faith, but to ſtand to his purpoſe, that hee might not reiect that people, whom he knewe before.</p>
               <p>And heere againe that is to bee noted whiche I admoniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, namely, that by the worde <hi>foreknow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Foreknowledge in God is not taken for a bare &amp; naked know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a thing to be.</note> is not vnderſtoode a certaine (I knowe not what) ſpeculation or beholding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God did foreknowe what euerie one woulde bee, but his good pleaſure, wherby he chooſe thoſe vnto himſelfe for ſonnes, who becauſe they were not yet borne, coulde not inſinuate
<pb facs="tcp:7612:161"/>
themſelues into his fauour. So to the Galathians, he ſaith they were knowen of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> becauſe he preuented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his fauour, that he might cal them to the knowledge of Chriſt. Now we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, although the vniuerſal calling doeth not bring foorth fruite, yet the faith of God is not fallen away, but alway he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth a Church, ſo long as the elect remayne aliue: for albeit God doeth indifferently inuite the whole people vnto him, yet he doth not inwardly draw any, but ſuch as he knoweth to be his, &amp; hath giuen to his ſonne: whom alſo he will keepe faithfully vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende. <hi>Know you not.</hi> Seeing there were ſo few, who of the Iewes beleeued in Chriſt, it could hardly be, but by the ſmalneſſe of the number, they ſhould gather that the whole ſtock of Abraham was reiected. And this cogitation alſo would creepe in, namely, that in ſo deformed a ruine there appeared no ſigne of Gods grace. For ſeeing adoption was the ſacred bond where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſonnes of Abraham beeing gathered vnder the faith of God, were reteined in the ſame, except the ſame had fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is no way like that the people could haue beene ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and vnhappily ſcattered. That Paule might turne away this offence, he vſeth a very fit example. For he ſheweth howe in the time of Elias, there was ſuch a waſte, ſo that now there was no appearance of a Churche, and yet when there appeared no footſtep of the grace of God, the Church of God did lie ſo hidde (as it were) in a graue, that the ſame was woonderfully preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. It followeth therefore, they doe naught who eſteeme the Church by their ſence.<note place="margin">The Church muſt not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our ſence.</note> And ſurely if that excellent Prophete, who was indued with ſuch plentie of the ſpirite, when he would by his owne iudgement eſteeme the people of God, were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: what ſhall befall vs, whoſe greateſt ſharpneſſe, if we be compared with him, is but meere dulneſſe? Wherfore let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree nothing here raſhly, but rather let this abide faſt in our heartes, that there is a Church nouriſhed by the ſecrete proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, when there appeareth none to our eyes. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all let vs remember, that they deale fooliſhly, and proudly, who define the number of the elect according to the meaſure of their ſence. For God hath a meane, vnknowen to vs, eaſie to himſelfe, whereby he doeth woonderfully keepe his elect, when al things ſeeme loſt. And let the Readers marke this, that Paule doeth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7612:161"/>
here, and els where, diligently compare the ſtate of his time, with the olde condition of the Church, which maketh greatly to the confirmation of our faith, whiles we conſider, nothing doeth happen vnto vs at this day, which the holye fathers haue not had experience of in olde time. For we know how harde an engine, newnes is, to trouble weak minds, touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parcel, in Elias, in the tranſlation I haue reteined the phraſe of Paule, becauſe it may ſignifie as much, as in <hi>the hiſtorie, or in the things done by Elias:</hi> although I thinke rather that Paul ſpake ſo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Hebrues:<note place="margin">In Elias, for, in the hiſtorie of Elias.</note> becauſe <hi>Beth</hi> which anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the greeke <hi>En,</hi> is often taken for <hi>de of.

But therein he was deceiued, that he condemned the whole nation, himſelfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impietie, which he would haue had ſo ſeuerely puniſhed. Furthermore, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place which Paul citeth, there is no imprecatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or wiſhing, but a bare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playning.<note place="margin">1.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if no conſideration of workes can be admitted in election, which doth not obſcure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> free goodnes of God, which he would haue ſo greatly commended vnto vs therein: let thoſe phrenſie perſons, which make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitie which God foreſaw in vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of election, ſee what they will anſweare vnto Paule.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7612:162"/>
that grace leaueth no place for woorkes. Paule doth not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute onely of our reconciliation with God, neither of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes or next cauſes of our ſaluation, but he aſcendeth higher,, namely, why God before the world was made, ſome being reiected, did onely chooſe other ſome.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſpeake here of election: yet becauſe it is a general rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which Paule vſeth heere, it ought to bee extended vnto the whole cauſe of our ſaluation: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might knowe, it is ſo often ſayde there is no merite of workes, as our ſaluation is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the grace of God: or rather that we might beleeue the righteouſnes of works is ſo often brought to nothing, as grace is named.</p>

                  <hi>7 What then?</hi> Becauſe he was occupied here in a harde queſtion, he maketh a demand as though he doubted. Yet by this kind of doubting, he goeth about to make the anſwere which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth more certaine: for he inſinuateth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no other ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be giuen. And that is, namely, that Iſrael in ſeeking ſaluation laboured in vaine: becauſe he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about it by a prepoſterous ſtudy. Although he make here no mention of the cauſe: yet ſeeing he had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it before, aſſuredly he woulde alſo haue it vnderſtood in this place. For his wordes are as much as if he ſaid, now it ought not to ſeeme ſtraunge, that Iſrael in ſtriuing vnto righteouſneſſe, hath profited nothing. And thence is that brought to paſſe whiche he addeth ſtraightwaies of election. For if Iſrael hath obteined, nothing by merite: what haue others obteyned, whoſe cauſe or condition was no better? Whence commeth ſo great difference amongſt equals? Here who doth not ſee, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection only which maketh the difference? And the ſignification of this word is doubtful. For it ſeemeth vnto ſome to be taken collectiuely for the elect,<note place="margin">Election put for the elect themſelues.</note> that the partes of the contrarietie may agree among themſelues: whoſe ſentence I diſlike not, ſo that alſo they graunt vnto me, that there is ſomewhat more in this worde, then if he had ſaide <hi>the elect:</hi> namely, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, howe there was none other cauſe of obteyning, then elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as if he ſaid, not they who labour truſting to their merits, but they whoſe ſaluation dependeth vppon the free election of God: for he doth preciſely compare that remnant whiche was ſaued by the grace of God, with all Iſrael, or the whole bodie of the people. Whereby it followeth that the cauſe of ſaluation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in men, but in the meere good pleaſure of God. <hi>The reſt haue beene blinded.</hi> As the elect onely are deliuered from peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing by the grace of God, ſo, who ſo are not elected, muſt needes remaine in blindnes. For this is the meaning of Paul, that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reprobate, the beginning of ruine and condemnation is hence, that they are forſaken of God. The teſtimonies whiche he bringeth, although they are rather gathered out of diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſcripture, then taken out of one place, yet all of them ſeeme to be ſtrange from his purpoſe, if you weigh them more neerely by their circumſtances. For euery where you may ſee excecation and hardening to be mentioned, as the ſcourges of God, whereby he puniſhed the offences of the wicked alreadie
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7612:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
committed. But Paule here contendeth to proue by them, that they are blinded, not who haue already deſerued it, by their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, but which were reprobated of God, before the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. This knot thou maiſt thus briefly looſe, that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of wickednes, which ſo prouoketh the furie of God, is the peruerſity of nature, forſaken of God. Wherefore not without cauſe hath Paule cited theſe teſtimonies of eternal reprobation, which proceedeth thence as the fruite from the tree, and riuer from the fountaine. Surely the godleſſe for their ſinnes, by the iuſt iudgement of God are puniſhed with cecitie: but if wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the fountaine of their periſhing, we muſt haue recourſe thither, that they being accurſed of God, can get and bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by all their deedes, ſayinges, and counſailes, then maledic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and curſe.

For thence commeth that diuerſitie, that ſometime he ſaith the Iewes were baniſhed from the kingdome of God, cut off from the tree, and by the iudgement of GOD, throwen into deſtruction: other ſome time againe he denieth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be fallen from grace, but rather to abyde in the poſſeſſion of the couenaunt, and to haue place in the Church of God. So then according to this diſtinction he ſpeaketh now. For ſeeyng the Iewes for the moſt part did reiect Chriſt, ſo that, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie did in a manner poſſeſſe the whole nation, and there appeared but fewe amongeſt them of a better minde. Hee demaundeth, whither the nation of the Iewes had ſo ſtumbled, that it were for euer to be diſpaired of, neyther were there any hope of repentaunce lefte. And heere hee woorthily denyeth the ſaluation of the Iewes to be paſt hope, or that they are ſo caſt off, of the Lord, that there is no reſtitution to be looked for, or that the couenant of grace is vtterly extinguiſhed, which God once made with them: ſeeing there remained alway in that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a bleſſed ſeede. That his meaning is thus to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode it appeareth by this, namely, that before he ioyned moſt ſure ruine vnto excecation, &amp; now maketh hope of riſing againe:
<pb facs="tcp:7612:165"/>
which two cold not agree in one. Then they are fallen, &amp; fallen to deſtruction, who were obſtinately offended at Chriſt: yet the nation is not ſo fallen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould follow of neceſſitie, who ſo is a Iewe he is loſt, or fallen away from God. <hi>But their fal is ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Gentiles.</hi> The Apoſtle in this place noteth two thinges: namely, that the fall of the Iewes turned to the ſaluation of the Gentiles: but to this end, that they might be kindled with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ielouſie, &amp; ſo bethinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of repentance. Surely he reſpected the teſtimonie of Moſes which he had already cited: where the Lorde threatneth Iſrael, that as he was prouoked of them through falſe Gods vnto emulation: ſo alſo by the lawe of retaliation he would prouoke them with a fooliſh people. The word that is vſed there, noteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affection of emulation and ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: namely, that we burne, when we ſee another preferred before vs. Then if the counſaile of the Lord be, that Iſrael ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoked vnto emulation, Iſrael is not therefore fallen, that hee ſhould be throwen into eternall deſtruction: but that the bleſſing of God,<note place="margin">The Iewes are not therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected that they ſhould vtterly periſhe.</note> which was contemned of them, might come vnto the gentiles: to the end that they alſo at length, might bee ſtirred to ſeeke the Lorde, from whom they are fallen. But there is no cauſe why the readers ſhoulde greatly weary themſelues in applying the teſtimonie: for Paule doth not vrge the proper ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the worde, but only alludeth vnto the vulgare and knowen manner. For as emulation prouoketh the wife being reiected from her huſband for her fault, that ſhe ſhould ſtudie to reconcile herſelfe: ſo now he ſaith it may come to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when the Iewes ſhall ſee the Gentiles placed in their roome, they beeing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the ſorow of their diuorcement, ſhould ſeeke for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
               <p n="12">

In which compariſon wee muſt remember, that man is not compared with man, but natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with nation.

Therfore they were ſanctified by the holy couenant, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with peculier honour, wherwithal the Lord did not vouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe the gentiles at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time: but becauſe little vertue of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt appeared then, he biddeth vs looke vnto Abraham and the Patriarches, with whom aſſuredly the bleſſing of God was not in vaine or voide. He therefore gathereth, that hereditarie holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe deſcended from them to al the poſteritie: whiche collection could not hold, if he ſpake of the perſons only, and rather had not regard vnto the promiſe. For it followeth not ſtraightwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the father was iuſt, therefore he paſſeth ouer his honeſtie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſonne: but becauſe the Lord ſanctified to himſelfe Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon this condition, that his ſeede alſo ſhould be holy:<note place="margin">How the whole nation of the Iewes is ſaid to be ſanctified in Abraham.</note> and ſo put ſanctitie not onely into the perſon of Abraham, but alſo into the whole kinred: therupon Paul doth not reaſon amiſſe, that al the Iewes were ſanctified in their father Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally, to prooue that, he bringeth two ſimilitudes: the former being taken from the ceremonies of the law: and the other taken from nature.

Therfore it is no maruell, though the Iewes be ſanctified in their father Abraham. Here ſhall be no difficultie, if thou doeſt vnderſtande ſanctitie to bee nothing els, then ſpirituall nobilitie of ſtocke, and the ſame not proper to nature, but whiche did proceede from the couenaunt.

I confeſſe it ſhabe truely ſaid, that the Iewes were naturally holy, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adoption was hereditary amongſt them: but now I ſpeake of the firſt nature, according to the which we know all are curſed in Adam.

For the original of the Gentiles, was (as it were) of a wilde and barren oliue: becauſe they founde nothing in their whole petegrie but malediction. Therfore whatſoeuer glorie they haue, that is of the newe graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and not of the olde ſtocke: there is then no cauſe why the Gentiles ſhould boaſt themſelues of any honour of theirs, aboue the Iewes.

Looke therfore how abſurd it ſhould be for the braunches proudly to boaſt themſelues againſt the roote: ſo abſurde it were for the gentiles to glorie againſt the Iewes: namely in reſpect of the excellency of kinred. For Paule would haue it alway weighed, whence the beginning of ſaluation is. And we knowe, after Chriſt by his comming had pulled downe the partition wall, the whole worlde was repleniſhed with that grace, which God before had layde vp with an elect people. Whereby it followeth, that the calling of the gentiles is like to a grafting, neither did they otherwiſe growe vppe into the people of GOD, then as they tooke roote in the ſtocke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</p>

Therefore Paule denounceth agaynſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, if they aduaunce them ſelues agaynſt the Iewes, that there is prepared a rewarde for their pride, becauſe God wil againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile to himſelfe that former people, with whom he made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement.</p>

                  <hi>22 Beholde therefore.</hi> By putting downe the thing it ſelfe, yet hee doth more clearely and amply confirme, that the Gentiles haue none occaſion to bee proude. They doe ſee in the Iewes an example of Gods ſeueritie, which ought to feare them: but in them ſelues they haue a teſtimonie of his grace and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7612:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
goodnes, whereby they ought to be prouoked vnto thankfulneſſe only, and to prayſe the Lord and not themſelues. Theſe woordes therefore are as much as if he ſaid, if thou doeſt triumph at their calamitie, firſt remember what thou waſt, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſeueritie of God did hang ouer thy head, but that thou waſt deliuered by his free mercie. Secondly conſider alſo what thou art now: for thou ſhalt not otherwiſe be ſaued, then if thou acknowledg the mercie of God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> humilitie: but if thou forgeting thy ſelf, doeſt inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly triumph, the ſame ruine doth abide for thee into the which they are fallen. For it is not inough to haue once imbraced the grace of God, vnles through the whole courſe of life,<note place="margin">It ſufficeth not to haue begun well.</note> thou doeſt follow his calling. For they who are illuminated of the Lorde muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way think of perſeuerance, ſeeing they abide not in the goodnes of God, who after they haue ſometime anſwered his calling, at length begin to diſpiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of God: &amp; ſo by their vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes deſerue to be blinded again. Furthermore he doth not one by one ſpeak vnto euery one of the godly, but (as we ſaid before) he compareth the Gentiles together with the Iewes. In deed it is true, that euery of the Iewes did receiue the rewarde of their incredulity, when they were baniſhed from the kingdom of God, and who ſo of the Gentiles were called, they were the veſſels of the mercy of God: but in the meane while the counſell of Paul is to be holden. For he would haue the Gentiles to depend vpon the eternall couenant of God, that they might ioyne their ſaluation with the ſaluation of the elect people. Againe leaſt the reiection of the Iewes ſhould breede offence, as though their olde adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were void: he would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terrified by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might reuerently haue that iudgement in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For whence commeth ſo great licenciouſnes of curious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do almoſt neglect thoſe things, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to inſtruct vs vnto humilitie? &amp; becauſe he deſputeth not of euery one of the elect particularly, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body, a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is added, <hi>if they ſhal abide in his lenitie.</hi> In deed I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, ſo ſoone as any abuſeth the goodnes of God, he is worthy to bee depriued of the offered grace: but improperly ſhould this be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any of the godly particularly, that God had therefore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on him, when he choſe him, if ſo that he did abide in his mercy. For the perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith, which maketh perfect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect of the

And ſurely that horrible defection of the whole worlde which followed afterward, doth plentifully teſtifie how this admonition was not in vayne. For when God had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in a moment ſo watered far &amp; wide with his grace, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion floriſhed euery where, ſhortly after the veritie of the Goſpel vaniſhed, &amp; the treaſure of ſaluation was taken away. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce came ſo ſudden a change, but becauſe the Gentiles were fallen from their calling? <hi>otherwiſe thou ſhalt alſo be cut off.</hi> Nowe we vnderſtand in what ſence Paul threatneth vnto them cutting off, whom before he confeſſeth to be graffed into the hope of life by the election of God. For firſt, albeit this can not happen to the elect, yet they ſtand in neede of ſuch exhortation, to tame the pride of the fleſhe: which as it is in trueth contrary to their ſaluation, ſo ought it to be terrified with the feare of damnation. As chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans therefore are illuminated by fayth, they heare to their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, that the calling of God is without repentaunce: but as they carrie the fleſhe about with them, which wantonly kicketh agaynſt the grace of GOD, by this ſpeeche they are taught vnto humilitie, <hi>take heede thou bee not cut off.</hi> Howebeit that reſolution which I brought is to be remembred, namely that Paul ſpeaketh not here of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particuler electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery one, but oppoſeth the Iewes to the Gentiles: and therfore in theſe words he doth not ſo muche ſpeake vnto the electe, as vnto ſuche as did falſely boaſt them ſelues to haue gotten the place of the Iewes. Yea he ſpeaketh vnto the Gentiles to geather, and generally the whole bodie, wherein many were onely in title faythfull and the members of Chriſt. Whereas the demaunde is made of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler men, howe any may be cut off from the grafting, and howe after the cutting off he may be graffed in agayne: ſet before thee a threefolde forme of graffing,<note place="margin">A threefolde for me of grafting, and a twofolde forme of cutting off to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> and a twofolde forme of cutting off. For the children of the faithfull are graffed in, to whome the promiſe is due by the couenant made with their fathers: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they are alſo graffed in, who conceiue the ſeede of the goſpel in them, but which either taketh no roote or els is choked

               <p>The firſt ſorte are cutte off, when they refuſe the promiſe giuen to their fathers, or elſe doe not receiue it, through their vnthankfulneſſe. The ſeconde, When the ſeede of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel withereth and is corrupted in them. The perill of which euill ſeeing it hangeth ouer all men, in reſpect of their nature: wee muſt confeſſe that this admonition which Paule vſeth, doth in ſome ſort appertayne vnto the faythfull, leaſt they ſhoulde cocker them ſelues in ſlothfulneſſe of the fleſhe. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the preſent place, it ought to ſuffice vs, that the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God executed vpon the Iewes, is denounced againſt the Gentiles, if they ſhall become like vnto them.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <hi>23 For God is able.</hi> This were a colde argument with prophane men. For howeſoeuer they graunt power vnto God, yet becauſe they beholde it a farre off, as thoughe it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in heauen, they doe for the moſt part depriue it of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But becauſe the faithfull, as often as they heare the power of God to be named, do behold it as a preſent worke, hee thought this reaſon ſufficient to pearce their mindes. Adde alſo that hee taketh this as a maxime granted, namely that God did ſo puniſh the vnbeliefe of the people, that yet he forgate not his mercie: as els often, after he had ſeemed to haue baniſhed the Iewes from his kingdome, hee reſtored them agayne. And by compariſon he ſheweth, howe much more eaſily the preſent ſtate of thinges might be vndone, then it was done: namely howe much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie it is that the naturall branches, if they were put in their place, whence they were cut, ſhoulde take ſubſtaunce from their owne roote, then wilde and barren branches ſhoulde doe it of another.

Furthermore, this admonition was verie neceſſarie, leaſt the falling away of that people, ſhoulde trouble the weake aboue meaſure, as though the ſaluation of them all were for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bee deſpaired of. Although the ſame at this day is no leſſe profitable for vs, to the ende wee might knowe, that the ſaluation of a nomber left, which the Lorde at length will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto him ſelfe, lyeth hidde as it were ſealed with a ſignet.</p>
               <p>And ſo often as longer delay ſhall put vs in diſpaire thereof, let vs remember the name of myſterie: whereby Paule cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſheth, that the maner of their conuerſion, ſhall ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee common nor vſuall.

For it was not then as before, that ſome fewe Proſelites did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelues to the Iewes: but there was ſuche a chaunge, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles almoſt made the ſubſtance or bodie of the church.</p>
               <p n="26">
                  <hi>26 And ſo all Iſrael.</hi> Many vnderſtand this of the people of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, as though Paul ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religion ſhould be reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as before: but I extend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Iſrael vnto all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of God, to this ſence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentiles ſhalbe come in, the Iewes alſo ſhall turne from their defection vnto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith: and ſo the ſaluation of the whole Iſrael of GOD ſhalbe fulfilled, which Iſrael muſt be gathered of them both: yet ſo, that the Iewes haue the firſt place, as the firſt borne in the houſe of God. This interpretation doeth therefore ſeeme vnto me more conuenient, becauſe Paule here goeth about to note the conſummation of the kingdome of Chriſte, which is not included in the Iewes, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth the whole worlde. In the ſame maner, to the Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church conſiſting together of Iewes &amp; gentiles, the Iſrael of God, by that,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note> oppoſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gathered from the diſperſion, to the carnal ſonnes of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who were fallen away from his faith: <hi>as it is written.</hi> By this teſtimonie of Eſay he doth not confirme the whole ſentence, but one member onely: namely that the ſonnes of Abraham are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of redemption. For if any take it, that Chriſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and offered to them, but becauſe they did refuſe him, they were depriued of his grace: the wordes of the Prophete expreſſe more, namely that there is ſome number left, which after it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth, ſhall inioy the grace of deliueraunce. And yet Paule ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not worde for worde, that is reade with Eſai,<note place="margin">Eſai. 59.20.</note> the redeemer (quoth hee) ſhall come to Sion, and they which ſhall repent from iniquitie in Iacob, ſaith the Lorde. But it becommeth not vs to be too curious herein. For this is to bee regarded, howe fitly the Apoſtles apply vnto their purpoſe, whatſoeuer probations they bring out of the old teſtament: ſeeing they coueted nothing els, then as it were by the finger to point out, that the readers might he led vnto the fountaine.</p>
               <p>

For in that the Scripture calleth all the people of God Iſraelites, that is aſcribed to the excellencie of that nation, which God preferred before all others. Secondly, he ſaieth that he which ſhall redeeme, ſhall come, namely, vnto Sion, hauing reſpecte vnto the olde couenaunt. Hee addeth alſo, that hee ſhall bee redeemed in Iacob, whiche ſhall turne from his tranſgreſſion. In which words God doth plainely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto himſelfe a certaine ſeede, that the redemption might be effectual in the elect and peculiar nation.</p>

And Paule ſheweth they were ſo for a time through the prouidence of God blinded, that a way might be made for the goſpel vnto the Gentiles: and yet they not for euer excluded from the grace of God.

And this hee proueth by a notable ſentence: namely, that the grace and calling of God cannot bee voide.

declareth there is no cauſe why they ſhoulde diſpaire of others, which haue ſome hope of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for whatſoeuer they are now, they were as al others are: ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only mercy of god they haue eſcaped forth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnbeliefe, they ought to leaue place vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame mercy for others alſo. For as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning gyltines he maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes equal with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both of them might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the way to ſaluation is open to others as well as vnto them. For there is one only mercy of God which ſaueth: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may offer it ſelfe vnto them both. This ſentence therfore anſweareth that teſtimony of Oſe, which he cited before:<note place="margin">Oſe. 9.25.</note> I wil call that my people was no people. Moreouer, his meaning is not that God doth ſo blind al men, as though their incredulity were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him: but by his prouidence he hath ſo diſpoſed it, that all ſhould be guilty of incredulity, and ſo he might haue them ſubiect to his iudgement: to this end verily that all merits being buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaluation might be of his only goodnes. Here therefore Paul intendeth two thinges. Firſt, that there is nothing in anie man, wherefore he ſhould be preferred before others, beſides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meere grace of God. And ſecondly, that God in the diſpenſation of his grace is not let, but hee may beſtow the ſame vppon whom hee wil. There is an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in this word <hi>mercy,</hi> for it ſignifieth that God is tied to none, &amp; therefore doth ſaue all freely, becauſe all are in like ſort loſt. Furthermore, their dotage is too groſſe, who gather from hence that all ſhalbe ſaued. For Paul meaneth ſimply that as well Iewes as gentiles, are ſaued no other way then by the mercy of God: leaſt he ſhoulde leaue vnto any ſome matter of complaint. And ſure it is this mercy is offered indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently vnto all, but which ſeeke it by faith.</p>

                  <hi>33 O the deepeneſſe.</hi> Here firſt of all the Apoſtle burſteth foorth into a ſpeech which voluntarily ariſeth from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the workes of God with the faithfull. Secondarily, he doth by the way reſtrayne the boldnes of impietie, which is wont to murmure againſt the iudgements of God. Therefore when we heare, <hi>O the deepenes.</hi> It cannot be ſaide how auaileable this admiration ought to be, to beate downe the temeritie of the fleſhe. For after he had diſputed out of the worde and ſpirite of the Lorde, at length being ouercome with the highneſſe of ſo great a ſecrete, he can doe nothing but woonder and crie out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe riches of the wiſedome of God are deeper, then our reaſon is able to pearce into them. If therfore at any time we enter into talke of the ſecret counſels of God, let this bridle bee put alway before our wit and tongue, that when we haue ſpoken ſoberly &amp; within the bounds of the word of God, at length our diſputation end with an admiration. Neither ought we to be aſhamed, if we be no wiſer then he, who being rapt euen into the third heauen, had ſeene ſecrets not to be opened vnto man: yet here could finde no other end, then ſo to humble himſelfe. Whereas ſome reſolue the words of Paule thus. <hi>O the deepe riches and wiſedome, and knowledge of God:</hi> as though the nowne <hi>deepe</hi> were put for a common <hi>Epitheton,</hi> expounding riches for liberality: it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me to be wreſted.

For hauing ſpoken of iudgements,<note place="margin">Way is put for the reaſon or maner of Gods iudgement.</note> he addeth wayes for the rules or reaſon of doing, or order of gouerning of his iudgementes. And ſtill he perſiſteth in his exclamation: wherein the more hee extolleth the highnes of the ſecrets of God, the more hee frayeth vs from the curioſitie of ſearching. Let vs learne therefore to ſearche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing in the Lord, but which he hath reuealed by his ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for otherwiſe we enter into a labyrinth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there is no eaſie paſſage: for it is to be noted that heere the queſtion is not of euery the myſteries of God, but of thoſe which being layde vppe within himſelfe, he wil haue onely to be wondered at &amp; reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of vs</p>

hee beginneth as it were by laying hands on them, to bridle the boldneſſe of men, leaſt they ſhoulde murmure againſt the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and that hee doeth by two reaſons. The firſt is, that all men are altogether blinde to conſider the predeſtination of God, by their owne ſenſe: and to diſpute of a thing that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, is temeritie and wickedneſſe. The ſecond reaſon is, that wee haue no cauſe to complaine of God, ſeeing no man can ſay, that God is a debter vnto him: but on the contrary all men are bounde vnto him for his bountifulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Let euery one therefore remember to keepe his minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this compaſſe, leaſt in ſeeking after predeſtination, he be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aboue the reuealed will of God: ſeeing we heare that man can iudge no more heerein, then the blinde in darkneſſe.

Therfore as wee are not able by our owne ſtrength to finde out the ſecretes of God: ſo by the grace of the holy ſpirite wee haue acceſſe into the ſure and cleere knowledge of them.

the righteouſnes of God is mightily defended againſt all the accuſations of the wicked. For if no man hath by his merites bounde God vnto him, then none can iuſtly expoſtulate with him, becauſe hee hath not receiued a rewarde. For hee that will force any to doe him good, muſt needes ſhewe his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, wherby he hath deſerued ſo at his hands. This is then the meaning of the words of Paul, God cannot otherwiſe be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with vnrighteouſneſſe, vnleſſe it bee ſaide that hee giueth not to euery one their owne: but it is euident that none is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of his right by hym, ſeeing hee is bounde to no man. for what man can boaſt of any worke of his, whereby hee hath merited his fauour? And this place is worthie to bee noted, wherein wee are taught, that it is not in our power, by our good workes to prouoke the Lorde to ſaue vs: but hee preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs beeing vnworthie, by his meere goodneſſe. For hee doth not onely ſhewe what men are wonte to doe, but what they are any way able to doe. If ſo bee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we would diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelues, wee ſhoulde not only finde, that God is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to vs, but that wee altogether are ſubiect to his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that we haue not only deſerued no fauour at his hands, but alſo are more then worthie of eternall death. And Paule doth not onely gather, that hee is no debter vnto vs, becauſe of our corrupt, and contaminated nature: but alſo though man were perfect, yet he denieth that hee coulde bring any thinge at all before GOD, whereby he might winne his fauour: for ſo ſoone as man beginneth to bee, euen by the righte of creation hee is ſo bounde vnto his Creator, that hee hath nothing of his owne. In vaine therefore ſhall wee goe about to take from him his right, that hee may not freely, according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, deale with his owne woorkemanſhip, as though there were a mutuall regarde of ſome thing receiued and beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</p>
               <p n="36">
                  <hi>36 becauſe all things are of him and by him.</hi> This is a confirmation of the former ſentence. For hee ſheweth, it is farre off, that wee ſhoulde bee able to glory in any good thing of our owne, againſt God, ſeeing wee were created by him of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in him haue our preſent beeyng. Hereeby hee
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7612:174"/>
gathereth it to be meete, that our being ſhoulde bee directed to his glory. For howe vnorderly a dealing were it, that the creatures which hee hath made and conſerueth, ſhoulde bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes imployed then to the ſetting out of his glory? I know this particle <hi>eis auton,</hi> to be taken ſometimes, for <hi>en auto,</hi> yet abuſiuely. But ſeeing the proper ſignification ſerueth beſt to the preſent argument, it is better to reteine it, then to flee vnto that which is improper. The ſumme is, that the whole order of nature is euerted and ouerthrowne, if the ſame GOD whiche is the beginning of all thinges, bee not alſo the ende. <hi>To him bee glory.</hi> Nowe hee doeth boldly take vnto him the propoſition as though it were proued, for an infallible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: namely, that the glory of God ought euery way abyde immoueable. For it ſhall bee a colde ſentence, if you take it generally: but the force conſiſteth vppon the circumſtance of the place: namely, that God doth challenge vnto himſelfe an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authoritie, and that in the eſtate of mankinde, and all the worlde, nothing is to bee ſought for but his glory: Whereupon it inſueth, that thoſe cogitations are abſurde, and farre from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yea they are mad, whatſoeuer they be, tend to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diminiſhing of his glory.</p>

Seeing by that health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full knowledge of God and Chriſte, the ſoule is as it were rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, into a celeſtiall life: and by godly exhortations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the life it ſelfe is after a ſorte framed and faſhioned. For in vaine doeſt thou goe about to ſhewe the practiſe or ſtudie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and ordering the life, if firſt thou doeſt not ſhew vnto men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the original of all righteouſneſſe is in God, and Chriſt: which is to raiſe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead. And this is the principall differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Goſpell, and Philoſophie. For albeit the Philoſophers doe intreate of manners very excellentlie, and with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of wit, yet notwithſtanding whatſoeuer beautie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in their precepts, it is like a fayre building of an houſe without a foundation: becauſe the principles being omitted they propound a maymed doctrine, not vnlike a bodie without a head. Neither is the maner of teaching vſed in Poperie much vnlike. For although by the way they make mention of the faith of Chriſte, and the grace of the holy ſpirite, yet it is apparant how they come neerer vnto prophane philoſophers, then vnto Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And as the Philoſophers before they put down lawes touching maners, intreat firſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of goodnes, and ſearche out the originall of vertues, whence afterwarde they drawe, and deriue all duties: ſo heere Paule ſetteth downe the originall whence all the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that godleſſe men doe exceedingly abuſe vnto the diſſolutenes of the fleſh, whatſoeuer is ſpoken in the ſcripture, of the goodnes of God. Againe Hypocrites, as though the grace of God extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the ſtudie of a godlie life, and opened the doore of boldneſſe to ſinne, they doe maliciouſly as much as in them is, obſcure the knowledge of it. But this conteſtation or beſeeching doth teach, that men can neuer ſeriouſly woorſhippe God, nor be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prouoked vnto his feare and obedience, vntill they knowe howe much they are indebted vnto his mercie. The Papiſtes count it enough if by terrour they wreſt from men, a certayne (I knowe not what) forced obedience. But Paule, that hee might bynd vs vnto God, not with a ſeruile feare, but with a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie and cheerefull loue of righteouſneſſe, allureth vs by the ſweetnes of his grace wherein our ſaluation is conteyned: and withall he chargeth vs with ingratitude, vnleſſe, hauing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſo bountifull and liberal a Father, we ſtudie againe to dedicate our ſelues wholly to him. And ſo much the more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath Paule in this his exhortation, as he excelleth all others in ſetting foorth the grace of GOD. For that heart muſt needs be harder then iron, which through the doctrine he taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, is not inflamed with the loue of God, whoſe bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towardes him hee feeleth to be ſo plentiful. Where then are they which thinke, that all exhortations vnto honeſtie of life are taken away, if the ſaluation of men be repoſed in the onelye grace of God: ſeeing a godly heart is not ſo much prepared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the obedience of God by anie preceptes, or others, as by the ſerious meditating vppon the goodneſſe of GOD towardes him? Heere alſo we may ſee the lenity of the Apoſtles ſpirit, who had rather deale with the faithful, by admonitions and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſeechinges, then by ſeuere commaundementes: becauſe he knewe he ſhoulde profite more this way, with thoſe are trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. <hi>That yee giue your bodies.</hi> This is then the entrance of the right courſe vnto good woorkes, if we vnderſtande that we are conſecrated to the Lorde. For thereupon it followeth, that we muſt ceaſe to liue to our ſelues, to the ende all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our life, might tende to his obedience. Therefore here are two thinges to be conſidered. Firſt, that we are the Lords,<note place="margin">Two things to be conſidered.</note> ſecondly, that therfore we ought to be holye: becauſe it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely

for the holineſſe of God, that any thing ſhould be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, which was not firſt conſecrated to him. This beeing put downe, it followeth, wee muſt meditate of holineſſe all our life long: yea it is a kinde of ſacriledge, if wee fall to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe: becauſe it is nothing els, then to prophane a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thing. And euery where a maruellous proprietie of wordes is kept. Firſt, hee ſaith, our bodie muſt be offered in ſacrifice vnto GOD, whereby hee inſinuateth, that wee are not nowe in our owne power, but altogether brought into the power of God. Which cannot otherwiſe come to paſſe, vnleſſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our ſelues, and ſo denie our ſelues. Secondly, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Epithetons,</hi> he declareth what kinde of ſacrifice that muſt bee. For by calling it <hi>liuing,</hi> hee ſignifieth, we are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Lorde of this condition, that our former life beeyng killed in vs, we might be rayſed vp vnto newnes of life. Vnder the name of <hi>ſanctitie</hi> or <hi>holineſſe,</hi> he noteth that of the whiche wee ſaide, it is proper to the ſacrifice: for then it is a ſacrifice indeede, when ſanctification goeth before. The thirde <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theton,</hi> when hee admoniſheth that our life is then framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, when we direct this our ſacrifice vnto the pleaſure of the Lorde. And alſo it bringeth vnto vs a rare conſolation, in that he teacheth our ſtudie is pleaſing and acceptable to God, when we reſigne our ſelues ouer to innocencie and holineſſe.

               <p>There remaineth no ſacrifice of reconciliation, and it were great contumelie done againſt the croſſe of Chriſte to erect any. <hi>Your reaſonable ſeruice.</hi> I thinke this clauſe was added, the better to explicate and confirme that went before: as though it were ſaid, if you minde from your heart to ſerue God, giue your ſelues for a ſacrifice to god, for this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſeruice of God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which who ſo departeth, are but peruerſe worſhippers.

In deed the inuentions of men pleaſe them, and they bragge (as Paule ſaith in another place) a vaine ſhewe of wiſedome: But we heare what the heauenly iudge denounceth of the contrarie by the mouth of Paule.</p>
               <p>For by calling that a reaſonable ſeruice, which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, whatſoeuer wee goe about without the rule of his woorde, hee reiecteth as fooliſh, ſottiſh, and temerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices.</p>

                  <hi>That yee might proue what is the will of God.</hi> Heere thou haſt the end wherefore, wee ought to put on a newe minde: namely, that both our owne and all other mens counſailes, and deſires beeing reiected, wee might intende vpon the onely will of God, the knowledge whereof is true wiſedome. And if the renouation of the mynde be neceſſary vnto this, that wee might proue what is the will of God: Heereby it appeareth howe contrary it is vnto God. The Epithetons are added, doe ſerue vnto the commendation thereof, that wee might ſtriue thereunto with greater alacritie. And ſurely to bring our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie into an order, it is neceſſary that the true praiſe of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and perfection bee aſcribed vnto the will of God. The worlde perſuadeth it ſelfe, that thoſe workes it hath done, are good: Paule hee cryeth out on the contrary, that wee muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine by the commaundementes of God, what is right, and good.</p>
               <p>The worlde delighteth it ſelfe, and taketh great pleaſure, in his owne inuentions: but Paul affirmeth, that nothing pleaſeth God, ſaue that whiche hee commaundeth. The worlde, that it might finde perfection, ſlydeth from the worde of God vnto newe inuentions: Paule putting perfection in the will of God, ſheweth howe they are deluded with a falſe imagination: if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſe that marke.</p>

                  <hi>3 For I ſay by the grace.</hi> If thou doeſt thinke that the particle cauſall is not ſuperfluous, then this ſentence ſhall agree well with the former. For ſeeing nowe, hee woulde haue our whole ſtudie conſiſt, in ſeeking for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will of God, the next thing was, to drawe vs from vaine curioſitie. Yet ſeeing the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle cauſall is often ſuperfluous with Paule, thou mayeſt take it for a ſimple affirmation: for ſo alſo the ſenſe will ſtande very well.</p>
               <p>But before hee commaunde, hee ſaith, hee hath authoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, to the ende they might hearken vnto him, no leſſe then vnto the voyce of God himſelfe: for his woordes are as muche in value, as if hee ſaide, I ſpeake not of my ſelfe: but beeing an imbaſſadour of GOD, I bryng vnto you the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes hee hath inioyned mee.<note place="margin">Grace puc for Apoſtleſhip.</note> By grace (as before) hee meaneth his Apoſtleſhyp, whereby hee commendeth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of GOD therein, and withall inſinuateth, that hee did not temerouſly intrude himſelfe, but that he was choſen by the calling of God. So then hee getting vnto himſelfe authoritie, by this preface, doth binde the Romanes with a neceſſitie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyng, vnleſſe they woulde contemne GOD in the perſon of his miniſter.</p>
               <p>Then followeth the precept, whereby hee both draweth vs, from the ſearching of thoſe thinges, whiche doe nothing but trouble mens mindes, for they doe not edifie: and alſo forbiddeth leaſt any ſhoulde take more vppon him, then his capacitie and calling will beare. And withall admoniſheth, that wee onely thinke and meditate thoſe thinges, which may make vs ſober and modeſt.

So then there is a ſuperfluous ſeeking of wiſedome, not onely in ſuperfluous things, &amp; things vnprofitable to bee knowne: but alſo in thoſe, the knowledge whereof otherwiſe is profitable: when wee reſpect not what is giuen vnto vs, but temerouſly and boldly exceede the meaſure of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which importunitie, God will not ſuffer vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged.

The ſubſtance is, this is a part of our reaſonable ſacrifice, when euery one by a gentle and tractable ſpirite, doeth yeelde himſelfe to be ruled &amp; ordered of God. Finally, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he oppoſeth faith againſt humane iudgement, hee reſtraineth vs from our owne likinges, and withall purpoſely addeth the meaſure, that the faithfull ſhould alſo humbly keepe themſelues, within the compaſſe of theyr defect.</p>

For we are called of this condition, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould as it were grow vp into one body: ſeeing Chriſte hath ordeined that ſocietie and connection amongeſt all the faithfull, whiche is amongeſt the members of a mans body: and becauſe men coulde not come into ſuch an vnitie by themſelues, he is made the bonde of that coniunction. Seeing then that reaſon which is ſeene to hold in a mans bodie ought to bee alſo in the ſocietie of the faithfull: by that ſimilitude hee proueth, how neceſſary it is for euery one to conſider what is conuenient for his nature, capacity and calling. Furthermore this ſimilitude hath diuers parts, chiefly after this maner it is to be applied vnto the preſent cauſe, that as the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Howbeit when in expreſſe words he noteth that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is amongſt vs, withal he inſinuateth, how great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, there ought to bee in euery one, to beſtow thoſe gifts they inioy, to the common profite of the body.</p>

holpen by other mens giftes. But Paule his meaning was chiefly to beate downe that pride whiche hee knewe to bee graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in men, and leaſt any man ſhoulde bee greeued that al things are not giuen vnto him: hee admoniſheth, that not without the good counſaile of God, euery one hath his part giuen vnto him: becauſe it is neceſſary for the common benefite of the body, that none ſhoulde bee ſo furniſhed with the fulneſſe of giftes, leaſt he ſhoulde ſecurely deſpiſe his brethren. Heere then wee haue the principall ſcope, whereunto the Apoſtle tendeth: namely, that all thinges are not meete for all men, but the giftes of God are ſo diſpoſed, that euery one might haue his finite portion: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ought ſo to intende, in beſtowing his giftes to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, that no man hauing left his owne functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhoulde take vpon him another mans. For by this decent order, as it were due proportion, the incolumitie of the church is ſaued: when euery man doth ſo beſtow that he hath receiued to the common profite of others, that hee doth not hinder others, Hee which peruerteth this order, fighteth againſt God by whoſe ordinance it is ordeined. For the difference of giftes did not ſpring from the will of men, but becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lorde ſo to diſpoſe his grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether Propheſie.</hi> Nowe by bringing in certaine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers for example, he ſheweth howe euery man ought to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in his gifte, as in keeping his ſtation. For euery gift hath his ende propoſed, from the which to decline, is to corrupte the giftes themſelues. And whereas the ſpeech is ſomewhat confuſed, wee may ſo compoſe it, that the concluſion begin here. Hee therefore which hath the gift of propheſiyng, let him exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it to the proportion of faith: hee that hath an office, let him vſe it to adminiſtration: hee that hath doctrine, let him vſe it to teache &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They who ſhall beholde this marke, ſhall conueniently keep themſelues within their boundes. Howbeit this place is diuerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken. For there bee ſome which by propheſiyng vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the facultie of diuination, whiche was of force about the beginning of the Goſpell in the Churche: as it pleaſed the Lorde then to ſet foorth the dignitie and excellencie of his Churche by all meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:7612:179"/>And they thinke that that which is added, <hi>according to the porportion,</hi> is to be referred vnto all the branches. But I had rather followe them, who extende this woorde further, namely vnto a peculiar gifte of reuelation, that a man doe right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learnedly play the parte of an interpreter in opening the will of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore prophecying at this day amongeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is almoſt nothing els,<note place="margin">What propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng is amongſt chriſtians.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a right vnderſtanding of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſinguler gift of expounding the ſame, ſince all the olde propheſies, and oracles of God haue been finiſhed in Chriſt, and his Goſpell.

               </p>
               <p>For ſeeing in another place hee teſtifieth, that the ſpirite of the Prophete is ſubiect to the Prophete,<note place="margin">2.

In the other braunches there is leſſe difficultie. Hee that is (quoth hee) ordayned a miniſter let him diſcharge his duetie by miniſtring, that hee may be anſwearable to his name. As ſtraightwayes hee commendeth vnto teachers, vnder the name of doctrine, ſounde edification, in this ſence, hee that excelleth in doctrine, let him know that the ende thereof is, that the Church be truely taught, and let him ſtudie this one thing, that hee may make the Church wiſer by his doctrine.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And although theſe offices haue great affinitie, yea and alſo connection betweene them ſelues: yet they ceaſe not therefore to bee diuers.

For our fleſh (like an Aſſe) is alway lither or ſlouthful, and therefore had neede of ſpurres: and it is onely the feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the ſpirite, that correcteth our ſlouthfulnes: therefore the ſtudy of doyng good requireth a zeale, which the ſpirit of God kindeleth in our heartes. Why then, (wil ſome ſay) doth Paule exhort vnto this feruencie? I anſweare, although it bee the gift of God, yet it is the part of Chriſtians, that ſluggiſhnes being ſhaken off, they receiue that flame which is kindeled from aboue: as it often commeth to paſſe, that the motion of the ſpirite is choked and extinguiſhed by our iniurie. Hereunto alſo apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth the third, <hi>that we may ſerue the time,</hi> for as the courſe of this life is ſhort, ſo the oportunitie of doing good is ſoone paſt: therefore wee ought more cheerefully make ſpeede to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our dutie. So in another place Paule biddeth redeeme the time, becauſe the daies are euill. The meaning may alſo be, that we might know to apply our ſelues to the time, wherin there is great force. Howbeit Paule ſeemeth vnto me to ſet that againſt intermiſſion, ceaſing, or leauing off, which he commaundeth of ſeruing the time. Furthermore becauſe in many old copies, <hi>Curio,</hi> is read, which worde although at the firſt ſight it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſtrange, I dare not altogether reiect. If ſo bee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reading be accepted, I doubt not but the minde of Paule is, to referre all thoſe duties are done to our brethren, and whatſoeuer ſerueth to the mainteynance of charitie, to the worſhip of God, that hee might make the faythfull more willing.</p>

Finally, Paul doth not only prouok vs to prayers, but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requireth perſeuerance of vs: becauſe wee haue a continuall warfare, and dayly new conflicts ariſe, to the bearing whereof, yea euen the ſtrongeſt are vnmeete, vnleſſe they nowe &amp; then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new ſtrength.

Which meekeneſſe as it is more difficulte, ſo it is more ſeriouſly to be laboured for. For the Lorde commaundeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein hee requireth not our obedience.

becauſe we muſt giue place to wrath. And to giue place vnto wrath, is to yeelde vnto the Lorde the power of iudgeing, which they take from him, that take vpon them reuengement. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be a great ſin to vſurp the turne or courſe of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not lawful to reuenge: for ſo we preuent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgment of God, who wil haue this reſerued to himſelfe. And w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all he inſinuateth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they who patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly expect his help, ſhal haue God their reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger: but they who preuent him, leaue no place for the helpe of God. Moreouer he doth not only here forbid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we execute reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our ſelues, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our own hands, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our hart ſhould be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any ſuch deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is therfor ſuperfluous to diſtinguiſh between publik &amp; priuate reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Yea reuengme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not alway to be deſired of God, as we ſhal ſee ſtraightwaies: becauſe if our praiers proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a priuate affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pure zeale of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, we do not ſo much procure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord to be our iudge, as we make him the miniſter or executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of our wicked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence.

Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this error did poſſeſſe the Iewes aboue others, who thought it vnmeete that the progenie of Abraham, whoſe kingdome flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed before the comming of the Sauiour, ſhoulde nowe after his manifeſtation abide in ſeruitude. And there was alſo another thing, which did no leſſe alienate the Iewes then the Gentiles from their princes: namely, becauſe they did not only all of them abhorre from pietie, but alſo with moſt infeſtuous or deadly mindes, did perſecute religion. Therefore it ſeemed an abſurd thing, to acknowledge them for lawfull Lords and princes, who went about to take the kingdome from Chriſt, the onely Lorde of heauen and earth. For theſe cauſes it is like, Paul was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that with greater care hee might confirme the authoritie of Magiſtrates. And firſt of al, he putteth down a generall precept, where in ſummarily be comprehendeth that, he is about to ſpeake of: then afterwarde he addeth thoſe thinges which make vnto the expoſition, and confirmation of the precept. Hee calleth them <hi>high powers, not the higheſt powers,</hi> as though they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the higheſt empire or rule, but which excell aboue other men. In reſpect therefore of ſubiectes, and not in reſpect of them ſelues, one being compared with another, Magiſtrates are ſo called. And verily by this worde the Apoſtle ſeemeth vnto me, to go about to take away the curioſitie of men, who are often wont to enquire by what right, they which are in authoritie, came by their power: but to vs it ought to ſuffice, that they doe rule. For they haue not aſcended vnto this eſtate by their owne ſtrengthe, but they are placed by the hande of God. And whereas he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>euery ſoule,</hi> thereby hee taketh away all exception, leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould pretende an immunitie or freedome from the common ſubiection.</p>
               <p>

               <p>For if it be the Lordes pleaſure ſo to gouerne the worlde, he goeth about to inuert the ordinaunce of God, and ſo reſiſteth

God him ſelfe, who ſo deſpiſeth or reiecteth the authoritie or higher power: ſeeing to contemne his prouidence, who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ciuill gouernment, is to fight againſt him. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, vnderſtande that authorities or powers are of God, not as the peſtilence,<note place="margin">How the higher powers are of God.</note> hunger, warre, and ſuch like puniſhments of ſinne, are ſayde to bee of him: but becauſe hee hath appointed them for the lawfull and right adminiſtration of the worlde. For albeit tyrannies, and vniuſt dominations, in as much as they are full of deformitie, are not of the ordinarie gouernement: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the right of gouernement, is ordeyned of God for the health of mankinde.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing it is lawfull both to repell warres, and alſo to ſeeke remedies agaynſt other euilles: the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the authoritie and gouernement of Magiſtrates, to be willingly, and cheerefully receiued and reuerenced of vs, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto mankinde. For wee can not properly call thoſe puniſhmentes which God layeth vpon men for their ſinnes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces, but thoſe meanes which he hath purpoſely ſet downe for the conſeruation of a lawfull order.</p>

Therefore wee are to take heede leaſt wee fall vnder this ſentence. By iudgemente I vnderſtande not onely that puniſhment, whiche is executed by the Magiſtrate, as though hee woulde haue ſayde, they are iuſtly puniſhed that rebell agaynſt authoritie: but alſo euery vengeaunce of GOD, what way ſo euer it come.

                  <hi>3 For princes.</hi> Nowe alſo he commendeth vnto vs the obedience of princes by that profite commeth of them. Therefore this particle cauſal <hi>gar,</hi> that is, <hi>for,</hi> is to bee referred vnto the firſt propoſition, and not vnto the laſt ſentence. Finally,<note place="margin">The commodity for which God hath ordeined magiſtrates.</note> this is the commoditie: namely, that God by that meanes will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the tranquillitie of good men: and for the brideling of the way wardneſſe of euill men: in which two thinges the ſaftie of mankind is conteined. For vnleſſe the fury of godles perſons bee met withall, and innocent men bee defended from their luſt, all thinges ſhall foorthwith come to naught. If this then bee the onely medicine, whereby mankinde is deliuered from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccion, it ought to be diligently conſerued of vs, vnleſſe wee will profeſſe our ſelues to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publique enimies of mankinde. And whereas hee addeth. <hi>Wilt thou not feare? doe good,</hi> Thereby he inſinuateth, there is no cauſe why we ſhould bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Magiſtrate, if that we be good: yea,<note place="margin">The duty of the magiſtrate.</note> that this is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete teſtimonie of an euill conſcience, and one deuiſing ſome miſchiefe, if any goe about to ſhake off, or put from him that yoke. Howbeit heere hee ſpeaketh of the true, and as it were the naturall dutie of the Magiſtrate: from the which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they oftentimes which beare rule, do degenerate: yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience is to be giuen them, which is due vnto princes. For if an euill prince bee the ſcourge of the Lord, to puniſh the ſinnes of the people, let vs remember it commeth to paſſe through our fault, that the excellent bleſſing of God, is made a curſe vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs not ceaſe to reuerence the good ordinance of God: which thing we ſhall eaſily doe, if we impute vnto our ſelues whatſoeuer euill is in it. Hee therefore ſheweth here, to what end Magiſtrates are ordeined of the Lorde: whoſe effect ſhoulde alway be extant, if through our fault, ſo noble and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an inſtitution, were not corrupted. For ſeeing princes doe neuer ſo abuſe their power in vexing the good and innocent, but in their tyranny they reteyne ſome ſhewe of a iuſte domination: there can bee no tyranny, which in ſome reſpect is not a defence to conſerue the ſocietie of men. Heere alſo hee hath noted two parts, of the which, yea euen the Philoſophers themſelues haue thought the beſt compoſed adminiſtration of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth to
<pb facs="tcp:7612:188"/>
conſiſt: namely, the rewarding of good men, and the puniſhing of euill. The worde <hi>praiſe</hi> hath heere a large ſignification, after the maner of the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4 For hee is the miniſter of God, to thy wealth.</hi> Here, euen the Magiſtrates themſelues may learne what is their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For they rule not for their owne cauſe, but for the common profite, neither are they indued with an infinite or vnlimited po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but ſuch as is tyed to the health of their ſubiects. Finally, they are bound vnto God and men, in their principalitie. For becauſe they are the ſubſtitutes of God, &amp; doe his buſineſſe, they ſhall giue account vno him.</p>
               <p>Secondly that miniſterie which God hath committed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reſpecteth the ſubiects: wherfore they are alſo debters vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And priuate men are admoniſhed, that this is of the bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, to defende them from the iniuries of wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by the ſworde of princes. <hi>For they beare not the ſword in vaine.</hi> The other part of the office of Magiſtrates, is that they ought to repreſſe the laſciuiouſneſſe of wicked men, whiche wyllingly doe not ſuffer themſelues to bee gouerned by lawes: and to take ſuch puniſhment as the iudgemen of God requireth for their wickedneſſe: For hee doth plainely denounce them armed with the ſworde, not for a vaine ſhewe only, but that they might ſmyte euyll doers.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this ſaying <hi>the reuenger of wrath,</hi> is as muche as if it were ſaide, the executour of the wrath of God. And that hee proueth by the vſe of the ſworde which the Lorde hath giuen into their handes. A notable place to proue the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Magiſtrate. For if God in arming the Magiſtrate hath alſo commaunded him to vſe the ſworde: ſo often as hee puniſheth the giltie with death, by exerciſing the vengeance of God, he obeyeth his commandements. Therefore they contend with God, who thinke it an abhomination that the blood of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ſhould be ſhed.</p>

                  <hi>5 Wherefore wee muſt needes bee ſubiect,</hi> Nowe by the way of collection, yet with a kinde of poliſhing, he repeateth that whiche hee cammaunded in the beginning touchyng the obedience is to be giuen to Magiſtrates: namely, how they are to be obeyed, not onely for the cauſe of mans neceſſitie,<note place="margin">The dueties of ſubiects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> but alſo that we may obey God. For hee hath put this worde <hi>wrath</hi> for vengeance or reuengement, which the magiſtrate may take for the contempt of his dignitie or calling: as though hee had ſaide, we muſt not therefore obey becauſe wee cannot freely reſiſte the mightie and thoſe are armed: as iniuries are wont to be borne which cannot be repelled: but voluntaryly we are to take vpon vs that ſubiection, whereunto our conſcience is bounde by the worde of God. Therefore albeit the Magiſtrate were vnarmed, and a man might prouoke and contemne hym freely, to wit, with out puniſhment for it, yet is it no more to bee attempted, then if wee ſawe preſent vengeance to bee at hande for it. For it is not the parte of a priuate man to take the regiment from him, whome the Lorde hath placed with authoritie ouer vs. This whole diſputation is of ciuile gouernmente. Therefore in vaine goe they about by this place to eſtabliſhe theyr abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tyrannie, whiche exerciſe authoritie ouer mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

               <p>Tributes therefore are well and worthilie paid, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ſo neceſſary charges. Concerning the maner of cuſtomes and tributes, this is no place for any larg diſcourſe:
<pb facs="tcp:7612:189"/>
neither is it our partes to preſcribe princes, how much they ſhoulde beſtow on euery thing, or call them to a reckoning: Yet is it meete they ſhould remember, whatſoeuer they haue of the people, it is as it were common goods, not an inſtrument of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate luſt and ryot.

And ſurely I denie not but it may bee taken <hi>ironicè,</hi> to wit, <hi>tauntingly:</hi> that he might graunt vnto thoſe admit no other lawe, then of charitie, their requeſt.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7612:189"/>
But in another ſenſe. Yet had I rather take it ſimply, becauſe I thincke Paules meaning is to refer this precept of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Magiſtrates, (leaſt it ſhould be thought of any to bee but weake) vnto the lawe of charitie, as though he had ſaid, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I require you to obey, I require nothing els but that which all Chriſtians ought to performe by the law of charitie. For if you woulde haue the godly to bee ſafe (which thing not to will were cruell) you muſt ſtudie that lawes and iudgementes may bee of ſtrength, and the gouernours of the lawes, by whoſe benefite peace redoundeth to al, may haue an obedient people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he violateth charitie, if any bring in <hi>anarchia,</hi> libertie, ſuch as when there is no magiſtrate euery man doth his pleaſure, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which doth ſtraightwaies follow a perturbation of al things. For <hi>he that loueth another hath fulfilled the lawe.</hi> The counſaile of Paule is to reuoke all the commandementes of the law vnto loue, that we may know, how we then rightly obey the commandements, when we keepe charitie: and this, that we refuſe no labour which may make to the keeping of charitie. So he confirmeth very well that he commaunded touching the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to be giuen to magiſtrates, wherein the greateſt part of charitie both conſiſt. But here many are troubled, and cannot wel vnfold themſelues out of this difficultie: namely, that Paul ſaith the law is fulfilled if we loue our neighbour: for ſo there is no mention of the worſhip of God which ought not to bee omitted. But Paule hath not reſpect vnto the whole lawe: hee ſpeaketh here only of thoſe duties which are commanded vs of the lawe towards our neighbour. And ſurely that is true, the whole law is fulfilled, when we loue our neighbours, becauſe true loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, proceedeth not but from the loue of God, and is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie as wel as an effect thereof. Yet Paule here maketh mention onely of the ſeconde table, for the queſtion was onely of that: as though he had ſaide, he hath done his dutie towardes all the worlde, which loueth his neighbour as himſelfe. That cauill of Sophiſters is childiſh which goe about to draw iuſtification of workes out of this ſentence. For Paule ſaith not what men do, or doe not, but hee ſpeaketh vnder a condition, which thou ſhalt no where finde to be fulfilled. And when wee ſay men are not iuſtified by workes, we denis not but the keeping of the
<pb facs="tcp:7612:190"/>
law is true righteouſneſſe: but becauſe no man doeth nor hath performed it, we ſay all men are excluded from it, and therefore the onely refuge is in the grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <hi>9 For that thou ſhalt not commit adulterie.</hi> Hence it cannot be gathered what commandements are in the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſeeing in the end alſo he addeth, <hi>and if there be any other commandement.</hi> For he omitted the commandement of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parentes: And it may ſeeme very abſurd, that that ſhould be omitted, which chiefly apperteined to the purpoſe.

And yet the quiet reader will eaſily confeſſe, that Paule would proue by compariſons, how the whole law tendeth to this, that mutuall charitie might be maintained amongſt vs: and this is to bee vnderſtood which he omitted, that obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towards magiſtrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he that is indued with true charitie will neuer ſtudie to hurt his brother. What els doth the whole law forbid, then that we ſhould do no iniurie to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Furthermore, this muſt be applied vnto the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for ſeeing Magiſtrates are the gouernours of peace &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: who ſo coueteth that euery man may haue his owne, &amp; would haue all men liue in ſafetie, he muſt defend as much as lyeth in him the eſtates of Magiſtrates.

For it dependeth vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine: as in latine we ſay, <hi>adhaec vel pretereà.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, or furthermore. He ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time or ſeaſon is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the faithfull, becauſe the day of Gods calling and viſitation requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth newe life and newe maners, as for expoſition ſake he addeth afterwarde, it is time to ariſe. For it is not <hi>Chronos</hi> but <hi>Kairos,</hi> by which worde is noted the occaſion or fit time. <hi>For nowe is our ſaluation neerer.</hi> This place is diuerſty wreſted of the interpretours, many referre the worde, <hi>beleeued,</hi> vnto the tyme of the law, as though Paul ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes beleeued before Chriſt came, which interpretation I refuſe as hard and coacted: And ſurely to reſtraine a generall doctrine to ſome ſmall part of the Church were abſurde.</p>
               <p>In all that congregation, whereunto he wrote, what one Iewe was there? Then this ſpeech ſhoulde not agree vnto the Romanes. Moreouer, the compariſon of night and day (in my iudgement) taketh away this doubt. This therefore ſeemeth vnto mee to be the ſimple meaning, now is our ſaluation neerer then when we began to beleeue: that it might bee referred vnto the time which went before faith. For ſeeing this aduerbe hath an indifferent ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this propoſition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſeemeth much more conuenient: as appeareth by that which followeth.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <hi>12 The night is paſt the day approcheth neere.</hi> This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſion he made mention of a litle before. For albeit the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as yet are not receiued into the ful light: yet very well hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parath the knowledge of the life to come, which ſhineth vnto vs by the goſpel, vnto the morning. <hi>Day,</hi> here, as in many other places is not put for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of faith (otherwiſe he wold not ſay it draweth neere, but it is preſent, yea now it ſhineth as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midſt of his courſe) but for that brightneſſe of the celeſtiall life, whoſe beginnings are now ſeene, in the goſpell. The ſumme is, as by the ſpring of the day we gather, that the full light of the ſunne is at hand, euen ſo as ſoone as God beginneth to call vs, we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we ought to intend vpon the comming of Chriſte. Hee ſaith, <hi>the night is paſt,</hi> becauſe we are not ſo ouerwhelmed with a thick miſt as the faithles are, in whom there appeareth no ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle of life, but the hope of reſurrection is ſet before our eyes by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7612:191"/>
the Goſpel. Yea the light of faith, whereby we know the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the celeſtial glorie is at hand, ought to ſtirre vs vp that wee freeze not heere vppon this earth. But a little after, where hee biddeth vs walke as vppon the day light, hee keepeth not the ſame metaphore: becauſe hee compareth the preſent ſtate, wherein Chriſt ſhineth vnto vs, to the day. But by diuers waies he goeth about to exhort ſometimes vnto the meditation of the life to come, ſometimes vnto the reuerence of the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <hi>13 Not in rioting and drunkennes.</hi> He hath put downe here three ſortes of vices, of the which he hath noted euery one by two names, to wit, intemperancie &amp; exceſſe in liuing or in diet: carnal luſt and that vncleanneſſe is ioyned to it: enuie and ſtrife, If theſe vices haue ſuche filthineſſe in them, that euen carnall men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to commit them in the ſight of menne, it is meete wee ſhould alway abſteyne from them whiche walke in the ſight of God, yea then when we are ſequeſtred from the ſight of men. In the third pare although contention goeth before emulation, yet there is no doubt but the mind of Paule is to admoniſh that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and ſtrifes proceede foorth of this fountaine: for whiles euery one ſeeketh to excel, &amp; enuieth another. And ambition is the cauſe of both euils.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <hi>14 But put yee on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This Metaphor is very vſuall in the Scripture, in thoſe thinges which make ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the adorning or deforming of man: both whiche is ſeene in apparrell. For a filthie &amp; torne garment diſhoneſteth a man, a handſome and cleane garment doeth greatly beautifie him. To put on Chriſt, heere ſignifieth to be euerie way defended by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his ſpirite, whereby we are made apt vnto all the parts of ſanctitie or holineſſe. For ſo the image of God is reſtored in vs, which is the only ornament of the ſoule. For Paule hath reſpect vnto the ende of our calling, becauſe GOD adopting vs doeth graffe vs into the bodie of his onelye begotten ſonne, and verily vppon this condition, that we putting from vs our former life, may become newe men in him. Wherefore in another place alſo he ſaith the faithfull put on Chriſt in baptiſme. Make no prouiſion <hi>for the fleſh.</hi> So long as we carry our fleſh about, we cannot altogether caſt away the care thereof:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation is ſo in heauen, that wee may ſoiourne in earth.</p>
               <p>

For ſeeing that the Lord in his law, had made a difference betweene meates, and pronounced ſome vncleane, whoſe vſe hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad: and ſeeing alſo hee had ordeined certayne feſtiuall and ſolemne dayes, commaunding the ſame to be obſerued: the Iewes who had beene brought vp in the doctrine of the lawe, from their childehoode, coulde not put away the reuerence of dayes, whiche they had learned from the beginning, and whereunto they had accuſtomed themſelues all their whole life: neither durſt they touch thoſe meates, whiche they abhorred ſo long. That they were indued with ſuch opinions, it was of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: for they would haue thought otherwayes, if they had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the certaine and cleere knowledge of Chriſtian liberty. But in that they reſtrayned them ſelues, from that which they thought to be vnlawfull for them, that was a token of godlines, euen as it had beene a ſigne of boldnes and contempt, if they had taſted any thing againſt their conſcience. Here therfore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth a moſt excellent moderation, when hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euery man to be fully aſſured of his counſell: whereby hee giueth to vnderſtande,<note place="margin">Nothing ſhould be done with a doubting or wauering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> there ought to bee in Chriſtians, ſuche a ſtudie and care of true obedience: that they enterpriſe nothinge which they thinke not, or rather are ſure doth pleaſe God.

For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Paule is nothing els, but to reſtraine the immoderate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whereby very many at a venture thruſt themſelues into matters doubtfull and vnknowen.

               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6 Hee that regardeth the day. &amp;c.</hi> For as much as Paul knewe certainely, that the obſeruation of dayes proceeded from the not knowing of Chriſt: it is not credible, that hee did whollye defende ſuche a corruption: and yet the woordes ſeeme to importe, that hee ſinneth not whiche obſerueth the day. For nothing can be acceptable vnto God, except it be good. Therefore, that thou maiſt vnderſtande Paules meaning, it is neceſſarie to put a difference betweene that opinion whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hath conceiued of obſeruing dayes, and the obſeruation it ſelfe, whereunto hee byndeth himſelfe. For the opinion is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious: neither doeth Paule denie that, who vnder the name of <hi>infirmitie,</hi> hath already condemned it, and will by and by condemne it more plainelie. But whereas hee who is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with that ſuperſtition, dare not violate the ſolemnitie of the daye, that is approoued of God: becauſe hee dare doe nothing with a doubtfull conſcience. For what ſhoulde the Iewe doe, who as yet hath not profited ſo muche, that hee ſhoulde bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the religious obſeruation of dayes? Hee hath the woorde of God, wherein, the obſeruation of dayes is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him. A neceſſitie is layde vppon him by the lawe: the taking away of that neceſſitie is not yet perfectlye knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. There remaineth therefore nothing els, but that hee expecting a larger reuelation, ſhoulde keepe himſelfe within the compaſſe of his capacitie: and not to vſe the benefite of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, before hee haue imbraced the ſame by faith. The verye ſame is to bee vnderſtoode of him, that refrayneth himſelfe from vncleane meates. For if in the perplexitie of minde hee ſhould eate, that were not to receiue a benefite at the hande of GOD: but rather a maleperte thruſting of his hande into thinges for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Let him therefore vſe other thinges, whiche hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth are graunted to him, and let him followe the meaſure of his owne vnderſtanding. So ſhall hee giue thankes to the Lorde, whiche hee cannot doe, except hee bee perſwaded that he is fedde by the benefite of God. Therefore hee is not to bee deſpiſed, as though by this his ſobrietie, and Godlie feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hee offended the Lorde. Neyther ſhall anye abſurditye
<pb facs="tcp:7612:195"/>
followe if wee ſaye the modeſtie of a weake man is approued or allowed of the Lorde, not of merite, but of grace or fauour.</p>
               <p>Howbeit becauſe of late he required the certaintie of minde, leaſt euery one ſhoulde raſhly take vppon him the keeping of this or that at his pleaſure, we are to conſider if he doe not here rather exhort then affirme: becauſe this waye the Text ſhall runne better, namely, let euerie manne knowe the grounde or reaſon of that he doth, for hee muſt giue account at the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeate of God. For whether a man eate meate, or abſteine, he ought in both to haue reſpecte vnto GOD. And certainely there is nothing more apt, as well to reſtrayne the libertie of iudging, as to correct ſuperſtitions, then to cite vs before the tribunall ſeate of God: and therefore Paule very wiſely doth propoſe a Iudge before euerye one, vnto whoſe will they ought to referre or examine, whatſoeuer they doe. Neyther doth the affirmatiue ſpeeche let this acception: becauſe ſtraightway after he addeth, that no man liueth or dieth to himſelfe, where he reciteth not, what men can doe, but commaundeth what they ought to doe.</p>
               <p>And note that he ſaith we then eate and abſteine to the Lord, when we giue thankes. Wherfore both the vſe of meates &amp; alſo abſtinence is impure without thankeſgiuing. It is onely the name of God, which, whiles it is called vppon, doeth ſanctifie vs and ours.</p>

And we are not onely to liue vnto the Lorde, but alſo to die: that is, as well our death as life is to be reſigned to his wil. Heereunto hee addeth a notable reaſon, becauſe whither wee liue or die, wee are his. For thereuppon it followeth, that hee hath power ouer life and death. The vſe of this doctrine is very large. For ſo the Lordſhippe of life and death is aſcribed vnto GOD, that euery man might the better beare his eſtate, as the yoke impoſed by him, for it is meete hee ſhoulde aſſigne to euerye one his ſtanding and courſe. And ſo wee are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye forbidven, raſhely to take in hande this or that without the commaundement of God, but alſo wee are commaunded to be patient in all griefes and loſſes. If therefore at anye time the fleſhe ſtarte aſide in aduerſitie, let vs remember, that hee, who is not free, neither hath power ouer himſelfe, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth peruerte right and order, if hee depende not vppon the becke of his Lorde. By this meanes alſo is deliuered vnto vs a rule to liue and dye, ſo that if hee prolonge our life by continuall miſeries and ſorowes, yet we couet not to departe before our time.

               <p>Furthermore, euen that alſo coulde not be, except the Lord ſate in iudgement: therefore hath he well applied this teſtimony vnto the tribunall of Chriſt.

Nowe then if that bee fulfilled in Chriſt, which hee there challengeth to him ſelfe onelye, without doubte hee doeth manifeſt him ſelfe in Chriſt. And ſurely the veritie of that prophecie, appeared then cleerely, when Chriſte gathered vnto him ſelfe a people out of all the worlde, and brought them into the woorſhippe of his power,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> and obedience of his Goſpell.

And it ſhall then fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare when he ſhall get vppon his ſeate to iudge both the quicke and the dead: as all iudgement in heauen and earth is giuen vnto him of the Father.

But a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee addeth, that wee are not onely to reſpecte the meates themſelues, but alſo our brethren, before whom we eate. For we are not to count the vſe of Gods benefites ſo common, that it ſhoulde not bee ſubiect vnto charitie. His wordes therefore are as muche in value, as if hee ſayde, I know all meats are cleane, and therefore I leaue them free vnto thee, I ſuffer thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to bee looſe from all ſcrupell: finally, I doe not ſimplye driue thee from the meates themſelues: but the regard of meats beeyng layde a parte.

               <p>Yet notwithſtanding (as I ſaide,) hee hath applied theſe fewe to the preſent argument: for he that is made partaker of true righteouſneſſe, hee inioyeth a moſt excellent, and ineſtimable benefite, namely, the quiet ioy of conſcience.

Whatſoeuer then is ſet downe in Scripture, let vs labour to learne it. For it were contumely againſt the holie ſpirite, if we ſhoulde thinke hee hath taught any thing, whiche were not materiall for vs to knowe: ſecondly whatſoeuer is taught there, let vs know, it doth tende to the increaſe of godlineſſe.<note place="margin">The vſe of the old Teſtament is not done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> And although hee ſpeake of the old Teſtament, yet is the ſame to bee vnderſtoode alſo of the writinges of the Apoſtles. For if the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God hee euery where like it ſelfe, there is no doubte but now by the Apoſtles, as in olde time by the Prophetes, hee hath tempered his doctrine to the edification of his. Furthermore, by this place phanaticall ſpirites are notably ouerthrowen, who bragge that the olde Teſtament is done away, and belongeth not at all to Chriſtians. For with what face canne they turne Chriſtians from thoſe thinges, which Paul teſtifieth to be ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, vnto their ſaluation? And whereas hee addeth, that <hi>through patience and comforte of the ſcriptures, wee might haue hope,</hi> it comprehendeth not, all the partes of that profite, whiche is to be gathered by the worde of God: but briefly noteth the chiefe ende. For heereunto ſpecially ſerue the Scriptures, that they might erect the mindes of men: (Being prepared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to patience, and ſtrengthened by conſolations) vnto the hope of eternall life, and keepe them in the meditation thereof. The worde <hi>exhortation,</hi> for the which others tranſlate <hi>conſolation,</hi> is not diſliked of me: but that conſolation agreeth better with patience, becauſe this ariſeth, out of that. For then are we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to beare aduerſities patiently, when the Lorde doth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them with conſolation. For the patience of the godly, is not that hardneſſe which the Philoſophers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund: but that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wherby we doe willingly ſubmit our ſelues to God, whiles the taſte of his goodnes, &amp; fatherly loue doeth make all thinges ſweete vnto vs. The ſame nouriſheth and ſuſteineth hope in vs, that it faile not.</p>

               <p>Thereupon hee inferreth, that they ought to agree amongſt themſelues, and not contemne one another, ſeeing Chriſt did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne neyther of them. Firſt therefore hee ſpeaketh of the Iewes, and ſaith, Chriſt was ſent vnto them, that hee might fulfill the trueth of God, in perfourming the promiſes giuen to the fathers. And this is a ſinguler honor, that Chriſt being Lord

of heauen and earth, became fleſhe, that he might ſerue to their ſaluation. For the more he humbled himſelfe for their ſake, the more he honoured them. And that he taketh as vndoubted for a thing confeſſed: whereby it is more woonderfull, that there ſhould be ſo great impudencie in certayne phrenſie heades, that they doubt not to conclude in the fleſhe, and tye vnto this preſent worlde, all the promiſes of the olde Teſtament. And leaſt the Gentiles ſhoulde arrogate to themſelues anye digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aboue the Iewes, Paule plainelye denounceth that ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whiche Chriſte brought, in reſpect of the couenaunt, to be proper vnto the Iewes: becauſe by his comming hee fulfilled that which the Father in olde time promiſed to Abraham, and ſo was the miniſter of that people.

Finally, leaſt any ſhould cauill, that ſaluation was onely promiſed to the nephewes, ſeeing the couenant was committed to the hands of Abraham, expreſly he bindeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the fathers.

there is nothing more certayne then that Paule here alludeth vnto the ſacred myſteries, whiche were accompliſhed by the prieſt. Hee therefore maketh him ſelfe a Biſhoppe or Prieſte in the miniſterie of the Goſpell, who offereth in ſacrifice the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which he winneth vnto God: and in this maner hee worketh or laboureth in the ſacred myſteries of the Goſpell. And this aſſuredly is the prieſthoode of a Chriſtian Paſtor, by bringing men into the obedience of the Goſpel, to offer them as it were in ſacrifice vnto God: and not as the Papiſts haue hitherto proudly bragged, by the offering vp of Chriſt to reconcile men vnto God. Neither yet doth he here ſimply cal eccleſiaſtical paſtors prieſts, as by a perpetuall title: but Paul going about to commend the dignitie, and efficacie of the miniſterie, by occaſion hath vſed this metaphore. Let this therefore bee the ende vnto the preachers of the Goſpel in their function, namely to offer vnto God the ſoules of men being purified by fayth.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> afterwarde put downe by the way of correction, namely ſacrificing the Goſpell, is not onely impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but alſo doth darken the ſence. For the Goſpell is rather like a ſwoorde, wherewith the miniſter ſacrificeth men vnto God for offerings. Hee addeth that ſuch oblations are acceptable vnto God: which maketh not onely to the comnendation of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, but alſo to the ſinguler comfort of them, who yeelde them ſelues to be conſecrated. Nowe as the olde ſacrifices were dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God by externall ſanctifications and waſhings: ſo alſo theſe oblations are conſecrated to the Lord by the ſpirite of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, by the vertue of whoſe power inwardly working, they are ſeperated from this worlde. For although the puritie of the ſoule doth ariſe from the faith of the worde, yet becauſe the voice of man, by it ſelfe is vneffectuall and dead, the office of purifiyng is truely and properly giuen to the ſpirite.</p>

And alſo he putteth in mind of his fidelitie, which hee performed in diſcharging that function. For it is too ſmall purpoſe that wee are ordeyned, vnleſſe wee anſwere our calling, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our duetie.

ſhould be without profite. By the ſignes therefore he ſheweth, that God by the preſence of his power, did giue teſtimony to his preaching, and in a manner did ſeale his Apoſtleſhippe: ſo that nowe none ought to doubt but hee was ordeined and ſent of the Lorde. The ſignes are, <hi>woorde, woorke, and miracles:</hi> whereby appeareth that the name <hi>woorke,</hi> conteyneth more then myracles. At length hee concludeth, <hi>in the power of the ſpirite:</hi> whereby hee ſignifieth that theſe coulde not bee done, but by the ſpyrit. To be briefe, hee affirmeth that as well in teaching as doing, he had a power &amp; vertue in preaching Chriſt, wherein the woonderfull power of God appeared: ſecondly, he ſayeth <hi>myracles</hi> were added, which were as ſeales for the ſurer knowledge of that thing. Firſt hee putteth <hi>woorde</hi> and <hi>worke,</hi> then hee expreſſethe one kinde: namely the power of working myracles. So alſo it is taken with Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 24.19.</note> where hee ſaith, Chriſte was mightie in worde and deede. Alſo with Iohn, where Chriſt himſelfe ſendeth the Iewes vnto his works,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.36.</note> where they might haue teſtimonie of his Dietie. Neither doth he ſimply name myracles, but doth adorn them with two tytles. And whereas hee ſaith, <hi>The power of ſignes and wonders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 2.23</note> Peter in the Actes hath vertues, and ſignes, and wonders.

Therefore the Apoſtleſhippe of Paul was thereby manifeſt, that this propheſie is fulfilled in him. Wickedly ſhall any man goe about to drawe this vnto the office of paſtors, becauſe we knowe in Churches rightly ordered, where the veritie of the Goſpell was receiued long agoe, the name of Chriſt muſt be continually preached. To this ende therefore was Paul a preacher of Chriſt yet vnknowne, vnto forraine nations, that after his departure in euery place the ſame doctrine might dayly ſounde foorth in the mouth of the paſtors. For it is ſure that the Prophet intreateth of the beginnings of the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>30 And I beſeech you brethrrn.</hi> By many places it is ſufficiently knowen, howe greatly Paul was hated in his owne nation, for falſe ſlanders, as though he taught a falling away from Moſes. He knewe howe much reproches coulde doe to oppreſſe the innocent: and ſpecially with thoſe are caried with a raſhe zeale. Hereunto alſo came the teſtification of the ſpirite, whereof he maketh mention in the Actes.<note place="margin">Act. 20.23.</note> Whereby he was oftentimes forewarned, that bondes and afflictions were at hand for him at Hieruſalem. Therefore the more danger hee ſawe, the more he was moued. Hence came it he was ſo carefull to commende his health vnto the Churches: neither let vs maruell that he was ſo carefull ouer his life, wherein hee knewe ſo great danger of the Church to be handled.</p>
               <p>Therefore the vehemencie is in this obteſtation, beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe howe greatly the godly minde was troubled, whiles vnto the name of the Lorde, he addeth the loue of the ſpirite, whereby the Saintes ought to imbrace one another: but yet in ſo great feare hee ceaſeth not to goe on, neyther doth hee ſo feare danger, but he was readie to die willingly.</p>
               <p>Howebeit hee armeth him ſelfe with the remedies giuen vnto him of God. For he calleth for the helpe of the Church, that being holpen by their prayers, hee might thereby feele ſome

comfort, according to the promiſe of the Lorde: Where two or three ſhall be gathered together in my name,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20. Mat. 18.9.</note> there am I in the middeſt of them: and of whatſoeuer thing they ſhall conſent in earth, they ſhall obtayne it in heauen. And leaſt any ſhoulde thinke this were a remiſſe or light commendation, he beſeecheth them by Chriſt and the loue of the ſpirite. And that is called the loue of the ſpirite,<note place="margin">
                     <p>What is the loue of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>
                     <p>Prayers is the only hauen of refuge for the ſeruants of God in diſtreſſe.</p>
                  </note> wherein Chriſt doth ioyne vs together: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not of fleſhe, nor of the worlde, but of the ſpirite, which is the bonde of our vnitie. Seeing then it is ſo great a benefit of God, to bee holpen by the prayers of the faythfull, that euen Paul himſelfe, an elect veſſell of God, thought it was not to bee neglected of him: what intollerable btherneſſe ſhall it be: if wee wretches, and men of no price doe contemne it? Howebeit out of ſuch places, to take occaſion to maynetayne interceſſions vnto dead Saints, is a token of too much impudencie. <hi>That ye might ſtriue with me. Eraſmus</hi> hath tranſlated it well, that <hi>ye might helpe me labouring:</hi> but becauſe the Greeke phraſe hath more force, I choſe rather to tranſlate it worde for worde. For both by the worde <hi>ſtriue,</hi> hee ſignifieth with what perplexities hee was preſſed: and when hee biddeth them helpe him in this fight, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth what affection the prayers of the Godly for their brethren ought to haue: namely that they take vpon them their perſon, as though they were plunged in the ſame neceſſitie: laſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it ſheweth what effect they haue. For he which commendeth his brother to the Lord, by taking vnto him part of his neceſſitie, doth eaſe him ſo much. And ſurely if our ſtrength conſiſt in the inuocation of the name of God, wee can no way better confirme our brethren, then by calling vpon the name of God for them.</p>

                  <hi>31 That my miniſterie towardes Hieruſalem.</hi> The ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers by accuſing him, had ſo preuailed, that he alſo feared, leaſt his office ſhoulde bee ſcarcely acceptable at his handes, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſo great neceſſitie was conuenient or ſeaſonable. And hereby appeareth his wonderfull gentleneſſe, that hee ceaſed not to take paynes for thoſe, of whom he doubteth whither he ſhould bee thankefully accepted or no.</p>
               <p>This minde wee ought to followe, that wee ceaſe not to doe good vnto them, of whoſe thankfulneſſe wee are not aſſured.

And note that hee vouchſafeth them with the name of Saintes, to whome, hee feareth, leaſt hee ſhoulde be ſuſpected and ſcarſe welcome: hee knewe alſo that the Saints ſometimes might bee carried by falſe reportes, into ſiniſter opinions: &amp; although hee knewe they did him iniurie, yet hee ceaſeth not, to ſpeake reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of them. When he addeth, <hi>that I may come vnto you,</hi> hee ſignifieth that this prayer is alſo profitable for them, and it were good for them hee were not killed in Iudea. Hereunto apperteineth the parcell, <hi>with ioy.</hi> For this alſo ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Romanes, that hee might come vnto them mery, &amp; voyde of all ſorrowe, to the end he might more couragiouſly &amp; ſtoutly beſtowe his labour vpon them. And by the worde <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhe,</hi> or <hi>delight,</hi> he ſheweth howe aſſuredly hee was perſwaded of their brotherly loue.

               <p>Firſt of all, he commendeth <hi>Phaebe,</hi> to whome he gaue this Epiſtle to bee brought. And firſt hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth her by her office, becauſe ſhee had an honeſt and holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie in the Church: Secondly, hee bringeth another cauſe why they ought to receiue her, and doe vnto her all dueties: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7612:212"/>
ſhee had alway beſtowed her ſelfe vpon all the godly.</p>
               <p>Therefore becauſe ſhee is a miniſter of the Church at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> euen thereby hee commaundeth ſhee ſhould bee receiued in the Lorde. And when he addeth, <hi>as it is meete for the ſaints,</hi> hee inferreth that it were vnmeete for the ſeruants of Chriſt, if they ſhould ſhewe no honour nor bountifulneſſe towardes her. And ſurely ſeeeing it becommeth vs to imbrace all the members of Chriſte, then ought we to imbrace them which beare ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique office in the Church, and to reuerence them, &amp; to loue and honour them in a ſpeciall manner. Secondly, as ſhee was alway officious towardes all, ſo he commandeth that ſhe ſhould be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen now againe in her affaires. For it is a point of humanitie, not to forſake him, who by nature is readie to doe good, if at any time he ſtand in neede of the helpe of others. But to the ende hee might the rather moue their mindes, he reckoneth himſelfe alſo among them, to whome ſhe did good. Finally, this miniſterie of the which he ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.9.</note> of what ſort it was hee teacheth in another place. For as the poore were maintained out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie: ſo they were looked vnto by a publique office. And vnto this charge were widowes choſen, who being looſe from dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical cares, and hindered with no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did couet to conſecrate themſelues wholy vnto God by the dueties of charitie: therfore they were receiued into this functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though they were bound &amp; tyed: as he that ſetteth his labour, ceaſeth to be free and at his owne pleaſure. Whereupon the Apoſtle chargeth them to haue violated their faith, who afterward did renownce the office they had once taken vpon them. And becauſe they were to liue a ſingle life,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.11.</note> he forbiddeth them to bee choſen vnder threeſcore yeeres: namely, becauſe hee ſawe that the perpetuall vow of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life was dangerous, yea pernitious, to ſuch as were vnder that age. That holy office and profitable for the church,<note place="margin">The comming vp of Nunnes</note> the eſtate of thinges waxing worſe, did degenerate into the idle order of Nunnes: which order albeit it was corrupt euen from his firſt originall, and contrary to the worde of GOD, yet nowe it is ſo fallen from that beginning; that there is no leſſe differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then betweene ſome holy place of chaſtitie and a ſtewes.</p>
               <p n="3">

                  <hi>3 <hi>Salute</hi> Priſca <hi>and</hi> Aquila.</hi> Thoſe teſtimonies whiche hee giueth heere vnto many, doe partly tend to this ende, that whiles they are had in honour who are honeſt and worthie, both honeſtie it ſelfe might bee honoured, and they might haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with ſuch as coulde and woulde profite more then others: partly that they mighte anſwere to their former life, neither myght they faint in the courſe of godlineſſe, or their godly zeale quaile.</p>
               <p>It is a ſinguler honour which hee giueth here to <hi>Priſca</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> ſpecially in a woman. Whereby the modeſtie of the holy man, the rather appeareth, who neither thinketh ſcorne to haue, nor yet is aſhamed to acknowledge a woman for his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the worke of the Lorde.

And worthily was the life of one man ſo deare and precious to al the Gentiles, for it was an incomparable treaſure: wherefore it is no maruaile though all Churches of the Gentiles thought them ſelues bounde to his preſeruers. That which hee addeth of the Church in their houſe is worth the noting. For hee coulde not more honourably adorne their familie, then with the title of the Churche. For I doe not like the worde <hi>congregation,</hi> whiche Eraſmus hath tranſlated: for it is euident that Paule by the way of honour, hath vſed the ſacred name of the Church.</p>

Furthermore as euery one was the formeſt,<note place="margin">It is no ſmall honour when God choſeth any for firſt fruites.</note> in reſpect of time, called vnto the faith, ſo Paul doth giue vnto him the prerogatiue of honour: But this hath place, whiles the end anſwereth the beginning. And ſurely it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler honour, when God vouchſafeth to choſe any for firſt fruites. For by the continuance of time there commeth a greater and more ample proofe or tryall of faith, whiles they which firſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7612:213"/>
begun, are not wearie of running well. He teſtifieth againe his thankfulneſſe, whiles he maketh mention of thoſe things <hi>Marie</hi> did for him. And it is ſure hee aſcribeth theſe prayſes, that hee might make them more commendable to the Romans, whom he praiſed.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>7 Salute Andronicus.</hi> Although Paul is wont to make no great account of kinred, and other thinges appertaining to the fleſhe, yet becauſe that conſanguinitie which <hi>Iunia</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi> had with him, might greatly help that they might bee the more eaſily knowen, hee doth not neglect that prayſe alſo. There is more force in the ſecond ſpeech of praiſe, whiles he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them his fellow captiues: becauſe amongeſt the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian warfare, bondes are not reckoned in the laſt place. Whiles in the third place hee nameth Apoſtles,<note place="margin">The name Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle largly taken</note> he taketh not this worde in his proper and vſuall ſignification: But he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it further: namely, vnto all thoſe which doe not onely inſtruct one Church, but for the publiſhing of the Goſpell euery where, doe beſtowe their labour. They therefore who by cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the doctrine of ſaluation hither and thither, did plant chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are generally in this place called Apoſtles. For other where he reſtraineth it vnto that principal order, which Chriſt at the beginning ordeined in his twelue Diſciples. Otherwiſe it were abſurd that ſo great dignitie ſhould be aſcribed vnto them amongeſt few. Now becauſe they had by faith imbraced the Goſpel before Paule, he doubteth not in that reſpect to preferre them before himſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>11 Who are of the friendes of Narciſſus.</hi> It had been a thing too bad, that Peter ſhold be omitted in ſo long a catologue if he had been then at Rome.

And ſeeing they did worſhip Chriſt ſincerely, who liued vnder a huge Lion, vnder a moſt cruell ſpoyler, and corrupt man, there is no cauſe why ſeruants ſhould tary for their maſters, but euery one ſhould follow Chriſt for himſelfe. Yea, the exception added by Paule doth declare that his familie was diuided, ſo that there were but a few which beleeued.</p>

There is therefore no cauſe, why the Papiſts ſhould ſeeke a colour out of this place to procure hatred againſt vs: becauſe we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or pull aſunder the Goſpel of Chriſt, but the lyes of Satan, wherewith the Goſpel hath hitherto beene darkened. Yea Paul ſheweth plainly, that he doth not without exception, condemne euerie diſſention, but ſuche as diuideth Catholike faith.

For there is great waight in this ſaying. <hi>Which you haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> becauſe before that the Romaines were taught aright, they muſt needes depart from their old manners, and inſtitutions of their fathers.</p>

In deede hee is once ouercome of Chriſte, but yet not ſo, but he may continually renue warre: he promiſeth therefore the laſte putting of him to flight, which appeareth not in the midſt of the battaile.

of their brethren in the Epiſtle. Not that Paule ſtoode in neede of the teſtimonie of others, but becauſe the conſent of the godly auaileth much. And the Epiſtle (as wee may ſee) is concluded with the prayſe of God and thankeſgiuing, for he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of that ſinguler benefite of God: namely, that he hath vouchſafed the Gentiles with the light of the goſpel: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeareth his infinite and vnſpeakable goodneſſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this prayſe hath alſo in it that, which may ſerue to ſet vp and eſtabliſhe the confidence of the godly, that their mindes beeing erected vnto God, they may aſſuredly looke for all thoſe thinges, which are heere aſcribed to him: and alſo by his former benefites may confirme their hope touching that is to come. But becauſe by gathering many thinges into one ſentence, hee hath made a long Period or ſtoppe, which is wrapped with a diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red placing of wordes, euery member is to be diuided of vs.</q>
               <p>Firſt, hee giueth to God onely all glory: ſecondly, to the ende hee might ſhewe howe it is due vnto hym, by the way hee rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth certaine vertues of his, whereby appeareth, he onely is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of all praiſe. Hee ſaith hee is onely wiſe: which prayſe whiles it is giuen to him, it is taken from all the creatures. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Paul ſeemeth, after hee hath ſpoken of the ſecrete coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of God, purpoſely to haue added this prayſe, that he might drawe all men into reuerence and admiration of the wiſedome of God. For wee knowe, when men in the workes of God finde not out the cauſe, howe readie they are to murmure. By adding that God is able to confirme the Romanes, hee aſſureth them of final perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>And that they might more certainely depend on his power, he addeth that the ſame is teſtified vnto vs in the Goſpell: where thou ſeeſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel doth not only bring vnto vs preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grace; but alſo doth bring vnto vs aſſurance of grace ſtill to continue. For there, God doeth not onely promiſe to be our father in preſente, but alſo that hee will bee vnto the ende. Yea, his adoption is extended beyonde death, becauſe it bringeth vs vnto the eternall inheritance. The reſidue are put to commende the vertue and dignitie of the Goſpell. He calleth the Goſpell, the preaching of Chriſt, ſo that ſurely the whole ſumme thereof is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:7612:216"/>
knowledge of Chriſt: hee calleth his doctrine the reuelation of the <hi>myſterie:</hi> which ought not onely to make vs more attentiue in hearing of it, but alſo impreſſe an high reuerence therof in our hearts, and howe high a ſecrete that is, he ſignifieth, when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that from the beginning of the worlde by ſo many ages it was hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Verily it hath not a proud and hautie wiſedome, ſuch as the ſonnes of this worlde couet, of whom alſo it is therefore contemned: but it declareth thoſe vnſpeakable treaſures of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall wiſedome, aboue euery capacitie: which if the angels alſo themſelues do reuerence with admiration, ſurely no man can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wonder at it. Neither ought this wiſedom to be therfore leſſe eſteemed, becauſe it lieth hid vnder a baſe &amp; ſimple ſtile: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo it hath pleaſed the Lorde, to ſubdue the arrogancie of the fleſh. And becauſe great dout might ariſe, howe this myſterie which by ſo many ages was hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did ſo ſuddenly appeare forth: he teacheth, that that came not to paſſe through the temeritie of men, nor by chaunce, but by the eternall ordinance of God: where alſo he ſhutteth the gate againſt curious queſtions, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of mans wit is wont to moue. For whatſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſuddenly and beſides their expectation, they thinke it is done at vnwares: whereby they gather oftentimes wickedly, that the workes of God are abſurd, or at the leaſt they intangle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, with many troubleſome douts. Paul therefore admoniſheth, that that which appeared nowe ſuddenly, was decreed of God before the worlde were made. But leaſt any ſhoulde make a doubte therefore, that he might charge the Goſpell with newnes, and to defame it, he alleageth the ſcriptures of the prophets, where that was foreſpoken, which we ſee nowe fulfilled. For all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue giuen ſo large teſtimonie vnto the Goſpel, that it can not els where be better confirmed. And by this meanes God did rightly prepare the mindes of his, leaſt the noualtie of a thinge wherewith they were not acquainted, ſhould too much aſtoniſhe them.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> If any obiect that there is a contraryetie in the wordes of Paule, becauſe he ſaith that that myſterie of the which GOD hath giuen teſtimonie by his Prophetes was hidden in all ages, this knot is eaſily vnfolded by Peter, namely that the prophets,<note place="margin">Anſwere. 1. Pet. 1.12.</note> whiles they diligently inquired of the ſaluation offered to vs, did not miniſter to themſelues, but to vs. Therfore, God by ſpeaking
<pb facs="tcp:7612:217"/>
then, helde his peace, becauſe hee helde the reuelation of thoſe things, of the which he would haue his ſeruants to propheſie, in ſuſpence. Although it is not certainely agreed vpon among the learned,<note place="margin">Ephe. 3.9. Colloſ. 1.27.</note> in what ſence, both here and to the Epheſ. he calleth the Goſpel an hidden myſterie. The opinion of them, is more firme, which referre it to the calling of the Gentiles, which Paul him ſelfe preciſely toucheth to the Coloſ. Yet I, albeit I confeſſe that to be one cauſe,<note place="margin">Colloſ. 1.27.</note> can not be brought to beleeue, that is the onely cauſe. It ſeemeth more probable vnto me, that Paul had reſpecte alſo vnto the other differences of the olde and newe Teſtament. For although the Prophets in olde time, taught all thoſe things, which are expounded by Chriſt, and his apoſtles: yet they taught them with ſuch obſcuritie, in compariſon of the cleare light of the Goſpel, that it is no maruell, if they bee ſaide to haue bin hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which now are made manifeſt. Neither is it without cauſe that the prophet Malac. ſaith,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> there ſhould riſe the ſonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: neither that the prophet Eſai hath before hand ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended the embaſſage of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, nor that the Goſpell is called the kingdom of god: but we may better gather by the thing it ſelf, that then at length were the treaſures of celeſtiall wiſedome opened, when the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes being done away, God appeared to them in olde time, by his onely begotten ſonne, as it were face to face. Hee maketh mention agayne of that ende of the preaching of the Goſpell, whereof he made mention in the beginning of the firſt Chapter, namely, that God might bring all nations into the obedience of fayth.</p>
